<h1>The Scripture</h1>

<h2>Luke 2:25-33</h2>
<blockquote>
<i>
Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, “Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.” And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him.

<h1>The Legend</h1>

<h2>Saint Simon, the God-Receiver and LXX Translator</h2>

<h4><a href='https://www.oca.org/saints/lives/2023/02/03/100409-holy-righteous-simeon-the-god-receiver'>Orthodox Church in America</a>, <a href='https://orthodoxwiki.org/Simeon_the_God-receiver'>Orthodox Wiki</a>, <a href='https://tmora.org/online-exhibitions/transcendent-art-icons-from-yaroslavl-russia/17th-century-icons/st-simeon-the-god-receiver/'>The Museum of Russian Art</a></h4>
<i>
Saint Simeon was one of the seventy scholars who came to Alexandria to translate the Holy Scriptures into Greek. The completed work was called "The Septuagint" and is the version of the Old Testament used by the Orthodox Church...

Saint Simeon was translating a book of the Prophet Isaiah, and read the words: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive in the womb, and shall bring forth a Son” (Is 7:14). He thought that “virgin” was inaccurate, and he wanted to correct the text to read “woman.” At that moment an angel appeared to him and held back his hand saying, “You shall see these words fulfilled. You shall not die until you behold Christ the Lord born of a pure and spotless Virgin.”

From this day, Saint Simeon lived in expectation of the Promised Messiah. One day, the righteous Elder received a revelation from the Holy Spirit, and came to the Temple. It was on the very day (the fortieth after the Birth of Christ) when the All-Pure Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph had come to the Temple in order to perform the ritual prescribed by Jewish Law.

When Saint Simeon beheld their arrival, the Holy Spirit revealed to him that the divine Child held by the All-Pure Virgin Mary was the Promised Messiah, the Savior of the world. The Elder took the Child in his arms and said, “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word, for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people, a light to enlighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel” (Luke 2:29-32)...

Simeon blessed the All-Pure Virgin and Saint Joseph, and turning to the Mother of God he said, “Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against. Yea, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed” (Luke 2:34-35)...

The holy righteous Simeon the God-Receiver died at a great age (Tradition says he was 360). His holy relics were transferred to Constantinople in the sixth century. His grave was seen by the Russian pilgrim Saint Anthony, the future Archbishop of Novgorod (October 8) in 1200.

<h1>The Historical Record</h1>


<h2><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom'>John Chrysostom</a></h2>

<a href='#george-kedrenos'>George Kedrenos</a> (AD 1050) attributes the legend to Chrysostom:

<blockquote>
The receiver of God, Symeon the Jew, was one of those seventy interpreters who had translated the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek for Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, before the coming of Christ, as D. Chrysostom reports in his work on the six days [Hexaemeron]. And here Simeon, when he had read the prophecy of Isaiah, that a virgin should be pregnant and give birth to a son named Immanuel, completely derogated his faith by saying that human nature would not allow a virgin to bear at all. Thus it was divinely revealed to him that he would live until the prophet's oracle was fulfilled.
</blockquote>


<a href='#acta-sanctorum'>Jean Bolland</a> (AD 1665), in the Acta Sanctorum, quotes Kedrenos verbatim but then notes:

<blockquote>
But as regards St. Chrysostom, praised by Kedrenos in the Work of the Six Days; just as that holy Father was most famous for the multitude of his lucubrations, so how many of the same spurious offspring, from some of whom (for it is not read in his genuine works that Simeon was among the 72 interpreters) that Kedrenos himself had selected, were ascribed.
</blockquote>

Curiously, there is a homily from Chrysostom on Genesis 1:6 that speaks on the "work of the six days" and the Septuagint creation legend - however, it doesn't mention Simeon:

<blockquote>
<h4>[407 BC] John Chrysostom's <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/aquinasstudybible/home/genesis/john-chrysostom-homilies-on-genesis/homily-4-on-genesis'>Homily 4 on Genesis, Section 4</a></h4>
<i>
Listen attentively to what I am about to say to you, and do not be easily shaken by those who give you all their dreams. All the sacred books of the Old Testament were originally composed in Hebrew, no one contradicts it. Now, a few years before the birth of Jesus Christ, King Ptolemy, curious to gather a rich library, wanted to join our Holy Books to all those of various kinds that he had already gathered. This is why he brought some Jews from Jerusalem to translate into Greek, which they did happily. And this is how it came about, by a particular disposition of Providence, that not only those who heard Hebrew, but generally all peoples, were able to profit from our holy books. Is it not equally surprising that this design was conceived by an idolatrous prince, who, far from following the religion of the Jews, observed an altogether opposite worship? But this is how the Lord disposes all things, so that the enemies of truth are the first to break it.

Concerning this old man Simeon about whom you have asked, brother, whether he is Simon Sirach or not: you should know, O lover of truth, that people say many things about him. For some say that he is Simon Sirach, as indeed you, brother, have heard; some (say) that he lived 500 years, from the time of the captivity into Babylon until he received Christ in his arms in the temple and cried out to him saying "Now, Lord, release thy servant in peace"; some (say) that he was a priest with Zechariah and shared with Joseph the secret of our Saviour's conception and birth from the Virgin.

<i>
...from the commentary on Luke:

1. Some say, this is Simeon son of Jeshua son of Jozadak, in whose time the captivity went up from Babylon. And he lived five hundred years until he saw Christ.

2. Others: this Simeon was the son of Onias the high priest, and father of Jesus bar Asira who has the (Old Testament) book. And he was bound in spirit 219 years.

3. Others: this Simeon was a righteous man who went down in the captivity and despaired of restoration. And a revelation came to him. And he remained alive from the time of Jeremiah and king Josiah until (that of) Christ, about 570 years.

4. Others: he was high priest. And when he was reading in Isaiah and reached the place (7.14) "Behold a virgin conceives and gives birth" he doubted and said, "This cannot happen". And at once he was bound that he should not taste death until this should happen.

5. <b>Others: he was one of the 72 translators. And when he was rendering the book of Isaiah from the Hebrew language into the Greek at the command of Ptolemy in Egypt, he doubted (and said), "A virgin cannot conceive and give birth". And he was bound 272 years until Christ.</b>

6. Others: the Spirit bound him before of this: that he should become a herald of Christ and herald him, so that not only by miracles might he be believed to be God, but also by heralds - that is, Gabriel, and Zechariah, and this Simeon.

7. Others: the Spirit bound him because of this: (it was) on account of his "just"ness and "righteous"ness - that is, that he should see Christ and (Christ) reward him.

[Note, this passage in Moses' homilies seems to be quoting from Moses' commentary on Luke. Unfortunately, the only known MS of that commentary on Luke, MS Mardin Orth 102, has a lacuna at this point]

<i>
After him ruled Ptolemy, called al-Iksandrus, and nicknamed “the conquerer of Ur” for twenty-seven years. (In another text it is said:  “for twenty-one years.”) In his twentieth year of reign he ordered seventy Jews taken from Ūrashalīm and brought them to Alexandria, ordering them to translate the Torah and the Books of Prophets from Hebrew to Greek, placing each of them in a dwelling, isolated from the others, to see what was the interpretation of each of them.  When they finished translating the books, he saw their interpretations.  The versions were identical, with no discrepancy.  He then gathered the books together, sealed them with his own seal and placed them in the temple of an idol called Sirābiyūn.

Among the Seventy was a man named Simeon the Just, who took Christ our Lord [into his arms] in the temple. This Simeon, in explaining the Torah and translating the Prophets from Hebrew into Greek, found in every letter that he was transcribing, a prophecy about Christ our Lord, and in his heart he tried not to admit it by saying, “This is not possible!”  God therefore delayed his death, and he lived three hundred and fifty years until he saw Christ our Lord.  When he saw Him he said: “Now send your servant out in peace, O Lord, according to your word, for our eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared for the benefit of all peoples.”

And after him reigned a Ptolemy named Alexander (Arabic: al-Iskandar), and he was also called Ghalib Ur, for twenty seven years. And in another version it says twenty one years. And in the twentieth year of his reign he sent to Jerusalem (Ar. Urshalim) and summoned from there seventy men of the Jews to Alexandria (Ar. al-Iskandariyya) and he ordered them to translate for him the Torah and the books of the Prophets from Hebrew into Greek, and he placed each one of them in a house alone, on his own, so that he could see how the translation of each of them would be. And when they had translated the books, he looked at their translations and the translation was identical (lit. single), with no difference(s) in it. And he collected the books and sealed them under his seal, and placed them in the temple of an idol called Serapion (Sarabiyun).

And among the seventy was a man whose name was Sam‘an al-Siddiq who took our Lord the Masih from the Temple. And when Sam‘an translated the Torah and the books of the Prophets from Hebrew to Greek, whenever he translated a word (Ar. harf = word, letter of the alphabet) in which there was a prophecy about the Lord the Masih he would deny that in his heart and say “This is what cannot be”. But God made him live long so that he lived three hundred and fifty years until he saw our Lord the Masih. And when he saw him he said “Now, O Lord, release Your servant in accordance with Your word, in peace, for my eyes have seen Your redemption, which You prepared before all the peoples”.

Machine Translated: Emmanuel, born there of Mary, was circumcised on the eighth day, and after forty days was brought to Jerusalem, to stand before the Lord according to the law. and it was accepted by the righteous Symeon. the receiver of God, Symeon the Jew, was one of those 70 interpreters who had translated the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek for Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, before the coming of Christ, as D.

The holy gospel also teaches us this in two words (Luke 2) "he was endowed with the Holy Spirit, and from him he had received an oracle that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's anointed." therefore, seeing him in the temple, a child forty days old, he took in his arms, and, saying, "Now, Lord, let your servant go in peace according to your word," he went away joyfully to him.

And when that was done he ordered that the versions be compared and they were seen to be identical, and he sealed them with his seal and placed them in the house of his gods; and he treated these elders well, and freed for them the prisoners whom they had (viz., belonging to their nation) in Egypt. And Sam’an al-kahin, whenever he translated something of the Torah and the books of the prophets and the prophecies which they contain about the appearance of the lord Messiah, this would hurt him in his heart, and he would say When will this be?

The eighth of Amshir the blessed [= 2 February]

On this day occurred the entry of the Lord the Masih into the Temple, forty days after his glorious birth. And the righteous Joseph who was a servant in this mystery presented him, together with the holy Mary, his mother, so that there should be fulfilled what He, may He be magnified, imposed on the Israelite people. And the two of them lifted up the sacrifice ordained by Him in the Law. And Simeon the priest bore him in his arms – and this Simeon was a righteous man; and when Ptolemy the conqueror ruled in the year 5204 since our father Adam, he ruled also over the Jewish people, and he sent to the city of Jerusalem at the instruction of God and summoned seventy men from among the learned men of the Jews, and their judges and rabbis, and ordered them to interpret for him all the books of the Law and to translate them from the Hebrew language into the Greek language. And this was the instruction of God, that the Law should be translated for the Christian nation which was to appear after many years. Then he ordered that they be separated by pairs in different places, and that they be watched and that they should not be permitted to meet each other, in order that they should not act in concert over what they wrote, and not collude. And this was known to the Jews. And when they all translated the whole of the law, Simeon the Just struggled with the words of Isaiah [7:14]: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son”; he was afraid to write “a virgin shall conceive”, lest the king make fun of him, and not accept what he had written, and think that he was misleading him in what he wrote; so he wrote, in place of “virgin”, “girl”. Then he had internal doubts and he said (to himself), that a virgin should give birth is something that cannot be. And while he was thinking this, God sent drowsiness down upon him, and he slept. And (in his sleep) an angel of God appeared to him and said to him, This is the one about whom you doubted that you would see death before you saw the masih who is born of a virgin. And he lived after that for nearly three hundred years, until the Lord Masih was born, and he went up with him (sic) on this day to the Temple; and Simeon was blind, and when he took him in his arms he (was able to) see, and the Holy Spirit told him that “this is the one for whom you are waiting”, and he blessed God and said Now, O Lord, release thy servant, for He because of whom I have been bound to the life of this world that passes away has come, and I have seen Him, so release me that I may go to eternal paradise, for my eyes have seen Your deliverance which You prepared before all the peoples as a light made manifest to the nations, and a glory for Your people Israel. Then he said to His mother, This (child) is made for a fall and for a rising of many of the Children of Israel, meaning the fall of those who did not believe and the rising of those who did believe. Then he told her what would help her heart with its pain and its doubt about the state of the people, and he said The lance of doubt will enter your heart; and when he had completed everything that the Law commanded, he passed away in peace.

Plures quidem e Græcis Patribus citari hoc loco possent, sed dubium pariter est, num, quæ eorum nomine citantur, vere ab illis profecta sint: ex his præcipuos dabimus infra.

§ II. Refutantur aliquot de S. Simeone errores: an fuerit sacerdos.

[S. Simeon nec fuit] Præter ea, quæ de Simeone Lucas scripsit, nonnulla de eodem narrantur, quæ vel fabulosa sunt, vel a dubiis auctoribus scripta vel mutuata sunt. Ibi (in suburbio Bethlehem) inquit Cedrenus, scriptor Græcus, ex Maria natus Emmanuëlus, octavo die circumcisus, post quadraginta dies Hierosolymam adductus est, ut Domino secundum Legem sisteretur: acceptusque est a justo Simeone. Is Dei receptor Simeon Judæus, unus erat de LXX illis interpretibus, qui Ptolemæo Philadelpho, Ægypti regi, Ebraïcum vetus Testamentum in Græcum transtulerant sermonem ante Christi adventum, sicut D. Chrysostomus in suo de sex diebus Opere tradit. Atque hic Simeon, cum Esaïæ vaticinium legisset, virginem gravidam fore, partuque filium, Emmanuëlem nomine, edituram, fidem dicto prorsus derogavit, quod humana natura omnino virginem parere non admitteret. Sic ei animato divinitus patefactum est, victurum eo usque, dum vatis oraculum impleretur. Id nos sacrum etiam docet Euangelium his verbis: “Frat Spiritu sancto præditus, ab eoque oraculum acceperat, se non ante moriturum, quam Unctum Domini vidisset.” Eum ergo in templo videns Puerulum quadraginta dierum, in ulnas accepit &c. Simile quidpiam ante illum scripserat Eutychius, patriarcha Alexandrinus, seculo X secundum Seldenum, addiditque: Deus ergo vitæ terminum ipsi auxit, adeo ut annos trecentos quinquaginta viveret, donec Christum Dominum videret.

[14] [e 70 interpretibus unus;] Ptolemæus Philadelphus divinas Scripturas per 70 (seu 72) interpretes transferri ex Hebraïca lingua in Græcam curavit, ut scribit Eusebius libro posteriori Chronicorum, anno 2 Olympiadis 124, id est, anno 283 ante epocham Christi secundum Tabulam Olympiadum & Urbis Romæ ex Varronis sententia cum annis Christi connexionis, quam exhibet Ricciolius lib. 2 Chronologiæ reformatæ a pag. 105. His igitur stantibus, ac morte ejus initio epochæ Christi affixa, anno circiter ætatis suæ 67 Biblia Hebraïca in linguam Græcam vertere debuerit. Verum tanta Simeonis ætas non aliunde orta videtur, quam ex errore, quo sanctus Simeon cum altero Simone, cognomento Justo & summo Judæorum sacerdote, Oniæ II patre, confunditur; neque tantum illius senium speciem verisimilitudinis habet, merumque apparet commentum Talmudicum. Quod autem ad S. Chrysostomum, a Cedreno laudatum in Opere de sex diebus, attinet; quemadmodum is sanctus Pater lucubrationum suarum multitudine clarissimus exstitit, ita quam plurimi eidem fœtus spurii, e quorum aliquo (non enim in genuinis operibus ejus Simeon ex 72 interpretibus fuisse legitur) id ipsum Cedrenus excerpserit, adscripti fuere.

[Machine Translated]

Indeed, several of the Greek Fathers could be cited in this place, but it is equally doubtful whether what is cited by their name really proceeded from them: we will give the most important of these below.

§ II. Some errors about St. Simeon are refuted: whether he was a priest.

[St. Nor was Simeon] In addition to what Luke wrote about Simeon, there are some stories about him, which are either legendary, or were written or borrowed by dubious authors. There (in the suburbs of Bethlehem) says Cedrenus, the Greek writer, Emmanuel, born of Mary, was circumcised on the eighth day, and after forty days was brought to Jerusalem to stand before the Lord according to the Law: and was received by the righteous Simeon. The receiver of God, Simeon the Jew, was one of the 70 interpreters who had translated the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek for Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, before the coming of Christ, as D. Chrysostom reports in his work on the six days. And here Simeon, when he had read Isaiah's prophecy, that a virgin should be pregnant, and that she would give birth to a son, named Emmanuel, totally derogated his faith, because human nature would not allow a virgin to give birth at all. Thus it was divinely revealed to him that he was animated, that he would live until the oracle of the Lord was fulfilled. The holy Gospel also teaches us this in these words: "The brother was endowed with the Holy Spirit, and had received an oracle from him, that he would not die before he had seen the Anointed of the Lord." Seeing him therefore in the temple, a child forty days old, he took in his arms, &c. Eutychius, patriarch of Alexandria, had written something similar before him, in the tenth century according to Selden, and added: God therefore increased the limit of his life, so much so that he lived three hundred and fifty years, until he saw Christ the Lord.

[14] [one of the 70 interpreters;] Ptolemy Philadelphus caused the divine Scriptures to be translated from the Hebrew language into Greek by 70 (or 72) interpreters, as Eusebius writes in the later book of the Chronicles, in the year 2 Olympiad 124, that is, in the year 283 before the era of Christ according to The table of the Olympiads and the city of Rome from Varro's opinion of the connection with the years of Christ, which Ricciolius presents in lib. 2 Reformed chronology from pag. 105. Therefore, with these standing, and his death affixed to the beginning of the era of Christ, he must have translated the Hebrew Bible into the Greek language in about the year of his age 67. But the great age of Simeon does not seem to have arisen from any other source than from the error by which Saint Simeon is confused with another Simon, surnamed Justus and high priest of the Jews, the father of Oniae II. nor does it have the appearance of plausibility so much as that of the ancients, and appears to be a mere Talmudic comment. But as regards St. Chrysostom, praised by Cedrenus in the Work of the Six Days; just as that holy Father was most famous for the multitude of his lucubrations, so how many of the same spurious offspring, from some of whom (for it is not read in his genuine works that Simeon was among the 72 interpreters) that Cedrenus himself had selected, were ascribed.
