<h1>From Abel to Zechariah: The Bookends Argument</h1>

In Luke 11:51/Matthew 23:35, Jesus refers to "the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the altar and the sanctuary." 

The Jews use a different order of books in their Bible from Christians - they start with Genesis and end with 2 Chronicles. This is the order of books in the Bible that Jesus would have been familiar with as well.

Abel is from Genesis 4. The Zechariah that Jesus is referring to is from 2 Chronicles 24:20-22 (as that is the only example from the Bible of a Zechariah murdered in the temple).

Therefore by "blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah", Jesus was referring to the limits of the canon (from Genesis to 2 Chronicles) and did not consider later books like Maccabees as part of the scriptures.

<h1>Difficulties With This Argument</h1>

<h3>No one understood Jesus until AD 1780?</h3>

If Jesus was referring to the limits of the canon with "Abel to Zechariah", why did no Christian recognize that reference in recorded history until AD 1780?

* <b>Tertullian (AD 220):</b> Abel to John the Baptist was referring to the beginning of time until the present time[^terjb]
* <b>Origen (AD 253):</b> The meaning of Abel to Zechariah [the father of John the Baptist] is not specifically examined, but contextually seems to be referring to the beginning of time until the present time[^zjbo2]
* <b>Basil of Caesarea (AD 379):</b> Follows Origen, likely thought Abel to Zechariah [the father of John the Baptist] was referring to the beginning of time until the present time[^zboc]
* <b>Gregory of Nyssa (AD 395):</b> Follows Origen, likely thought Abel to Zechariah [the father of John the Baptist] was referring to the beginning of time until the present time[^zgon]
* <b>John Chrysostom (AD 407):</b> Abel to Zechariah [whichever Zechariah it was] was simply referring to a holy man slain in a holy place, and its purpose was to alarm the teachers of the Law and Pharisees and to comfort Jesus' disciples.[^zjchr][^zjchr2]
* <b>Jerome (AD 420):</b> The meaning of Abel to Zechariah [the son of Jehoiada] is not examined[^zjero], though a reasonable guess is he thought Jesus was referring to heinous examples of the 'murder of the prophets' (particularly since he didn't use this bookends argument to support his opinions on Tobit/Judith/etc)
* <b>Cyril of Alexandria (AD 444):</b> Follows Origen, likely thought Abel to Zechariah [the father of John the Baptist] was referring to the beginning of time until the present time[^zcyral]
* <b>Remigius (AD 533):</b> Abel to Zechariah [a priest] was simply denoting all the holy martyrs of both lay [Abel] and priestly [Zechariah] order[^zremig]
* <b>Bede (AD 735):</b> Follows Jerome, likely thought Jesus was referring to heinous examples of the 'murder of the prophets'[^zbede]
* <b>Thomas Aquinas (AD 1274):</b> By Abel (a shepherd) and Zechariah (a priest) are signified laymen and clerics (or active and contemplative)[^zaquin2]
* <b>John Calvin (AD 1564):</b>  Abel to Zechariah [the son of Jehoiada] was referring to heinous examples of the 'murder of the prophets'[^zrjc]
* <b>John Lightfoot (AD 1675):</b>  Abel and Zechariah [the son of Jehoiada] were named because the requiring of vengeance is mentioned only concerning them[^zjlig][^zjlig2]
* <b>Johann David Michaelis (AD 1750):</b>  Abel and Zechariah [the son of Jehoiada] were named because the requiring of vengeance is mentioned only concerning them[^zjdm]
* <b>Johann Gottfried Eichhorn (AD 1780):</b>  Abel to Zechariah [the son of Jehoiada] <u>was referring to the boundaries of the canon of scripture</u>[^zjgei]

It seems to accept the argument one would have to maintain that Jesus' contemporary audience understood him, but the meaning was lost in the next century or two, and was not uncovered again until 1780.

<h3>The order of the Jewish Canon</h3>


The argument asserts that the "Jews use a different order of books in their Bible from Christians - they start with Genesis and end with 2 Chronicles".

Which Jews, exactly? And from what time period?

Reviewing the historical record for all lists of the Sacred Scriptures (Jewish or Christian) we see that prior to AD 1200 no particular sequence of books is dominant. Following the Adath Deborim (AD 1207), numerous codices exist which end with Chronicles, becoming a more and more common practice that eventually becomes a standard with the invention of the printing press:

* <b>Melito of Sardis (AD 170):</b> Daniel, Ezekiel, Ezra[^clmel]
* <b>Bava Batra 14b (AD ~200-600):</b> Esther, Ezra, <u>Chronicles</u>[^clbava]
* <b>Origen (AD 240):</b> Daniel, Job, Esther[^clorig]
* <b>Cyril of Jerusalem (AD 350):</b> Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel[^clcyjer]
* <b>Hilary of Poitiers (AD 360):</b> Ezekiel, Job, Esther [some add Tobit and Judith][^clhilpo]
* <b>Cheltenham List (AD 360):</b> Daniel, Ezekiel, 12 minor prophets[^clche]
* <b>Athanasius (AD 367):</b> Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel[^clath]
* <b>Amphilochius of Iconium (AD 380):</b> Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel[^clamphi]
* <b>Apostolic Canons (AD ~380):</b> Psalms, Solomon books, Prophet books[^clapoc]
* <b>Epiphanius of Salamis (AD 385):</b> Daniel, Ezra, Esther[^clepip][^clepip2]
* <b>Gregory of Nazianzus (AD 389):</b> Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel[^clgon]
* <b>Jerome (AD 391):</b> Chronicles, Ezra, Esther[^cljerm]
* <b>Augustine (AD 397):</b> Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezekiel[^claug]
* <b>Council of Carthage (AD 397):</b> Esther, Ezra, Maccabees[^clcocar]
* <b>Innocent I (AD 405):</b> Maccabees, Ezra, <u>Chronicles</u>[^clinno]
* <b>Decretum Gelasianum (AD ~550):</b> Esther, Judith, Maccabees[^cldecgel]
* <b>Synopsis of Sacred Scripture (AD ~550):</b> Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel[^clsossc]
* <b>Codex Claromontanus (AD ~550):</b> Esther, Job, Tobit[^clccla]
* <b>Isidore of Seville (AD ~600):</b> Chronicles, Ezra, Esther [some add Ruth and Lamentations][^clisid]
* <b>Codex Amiatinus (AD ~700):</b> Esther, Ezra, Maccabees[^clcami]
* <b>John of Damascus (AD ~730):</b> Daniel, Ezra, Esther[^cljod]
* <b>Stichometery of Nicephorus (AD ~800):</b> Ezekiel, Daniel, 12 minor prophets[^clsnic]
* <b>Aleppo Codex (AD 930):</b> Esther, Daniel, Ezra[^clalepc]
* <b>Leningrad Codex (AD 1008):</b> Esther, Daniel, Ezra[^cllenc]
* <b>Adath Deborim (AD 1207):</b> Esther, Daniel, Ezra (claims that this is the right and true order, but the Babylonians alter this order and place Chronicles or Esther at the end)[^claddeb]

The only evidence hinting at a possible order of books that ends in Chronicles in the first millenium is the Talmud's Bava Batra (AD ~200-600) and Innocent I's Letter to Exsuperius (AD 405).

While Innocent I's letter ends with Chronicles, it actually includes the Deuterocanonical books earlier in the list (and thus doesn't support this argument, which excludes those books).

The Bava Batra does provide a canon list that excludes the Deuterocanonical books and ends in Chronicles, but the Bava Kamma in the same section of the Mishnah explicitly identifies Sirach (one of the Deuterocanonical books) as being part of the Hagiographa (third part of Hebrew Bible).[^bavak] In a similar vein, Epiphanius of Salamis (~AD 385) notes that the Jews of his day were still disputing the canonicity of Sirach and the Book of Wisdom.[^clepip]

This leads us to another possible explanation for the prior difficulty - perhaps the reason no one before AD 1780 realized "Abel to Zechariah" meant the start and end of the canon was because Genesis to 2 Chronicles only became a common order of books after AD 1207.

To accept the argument, it seems one would have to maintain that the Bava Batra reflects a Jewish canon order from an earlier time, which Jesus and his contemporaries would have been familiar with, but that was lost to Christianity and history shortly thereafter (save for the list in the Bava Batra).

<h3>The Identity of Zechariah</h3>

Jesus gives us certain identifying marks about the identity of Zechariah in Luke 11:51/Matt 23:35

* Martyred "between the altar and the temple"
* "Son of Berechiah"
* Possibly a contemporary of Jesus' audience: "whom YOU murdered"

The argument asserts that the Zechariah that Jesus mentions must be Zechariah the son of Jehoiada (2 Chronicles 24:20-22), as he is the only instance in the Bible of a Zechariah murdered in the temple. 

But Jesus was speaking to specific people, who had a knowledge that isn't limited by what is recorded in the Bible. What would they have understood Jesus to be referring to?

Here are the historical identifications of the Zechariah Jesus was referring to across church history:

* <b>Tertullian (AD 220):</b> Lists the righteous who suffered violence from Abel to Zechariah, then proceeds one further to John the Baptist who he describes as "the person himself, at the close of the law and prophets". The identity of the Zechariah is unclear (though the proximity to John the Baptist is interesting)[^terjb]
* <b>Origen (AD 253):</b> Zechariah the father of John the Baptist[^zjbo2]
* <b>Basil of Caesarea (AD 379):</b> Zechariah the father of John the Baptist[^zboc]
* <b>Gregory of Nyssa (AD 395):</b> Zechariah the father of John the Baptist[^zgon]
* <b>Jerome (AD 420):</b> Zechariah the son of Jehoiada[^zjero]
* <b>John Chrysostom (AD 407):</b> Says some identify this Zechariah as the father of John the Baptist, others as the prophet, others as the priest who is the son of Jehoiada[^zjchr]
* <b>Cyril of Alexandria (AD 444):</b> Zechariah the father of John the Baptist[^zcyral]
* <b>Remigius (AD 533):</b> Zechariah was a priest (implying either the father of John the Baptist or the son of Jehoiada)[^zremig]
* <b>Bede (AD 735):</b> Zechariah the son of Jehoiada[^zbede]
* <b>Thomas Aquinas (AD 1274):</b> Quotes verbatim the positions of Origen, Jerome, John Chrysostom, and Remigius.[^zaquin] Elsewhere he seems to prefer either the father of John the Baptist or the son of Jehoiada, supplying Jerome's arguments for the latter.[^zaquin2]

As we see, there was confusion - multiple possibilities exist.

Let us review all of the possibilities:

1. <b>Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada</b>
    * Martyred in the temple area <i>(2 Chronicles 24:20-22)</i>
2. <b>Zechariah, the son of Berechiah</b>
    * Son of Berechiah <i>(Zech 1:1)</i>
    * Martyred in the temple area <i>(Rabbinic Targum[^zechtargum])</i>
3. <b>Zechariah, the son of Jeberechiah</b>
    * Son of Berechiah <i>(Isaiah 8:2, Jeberechiah is just a fuller form of Berechiah)</i>
4. <b>Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist</b>
    * Martyred in the temple area <i>(Protoevangelium of James[^zjbpj], Origen[^zjbo])</i>
    * Son of Berechiah <i>(Origen ascribes this tradition to Josephus[^zjbo2])</i>
    * Contemporary of Jesus' audience (Luke 1:5)
5. <b>Zechariah, the son of Baruch</b> 
    * Martyred in the temple area <i>(Josephus[^zbjos])</i>
    * Son of Berechiah <i>(Josephus calls him the son of Baruch, which some bible dictionaries note is a variation of Berechiah)</i>
    * Contemporary of Jesus' audience <i>(in the future around AD 60)</i>

Which Zechariah an early church father thought Jesus was referring to seems to depend largely on which identifying mark is held as primary.

<h4>Whom YOU murdered</h4>

If, like Origen, you hold "whom YOU murdered" as the primary identifying mark, then the Zechariah must be a contemporary of Jesus' audience. That leaves the father of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5) or the son of Baruch mentioned by Josephus.

Origen seems to mistakenly conflate the two, resulting in the "son of Baruch" identifier being given to the father of John the Baptist. Modern scholars simply note we aren't given the name of the father of Zechariah (the father of John the Baptist), it could plausibly be Berechiah... or literally anything else. 

Both the father of John the Baptist and the son of Baruch were martyred in the temple area - one is recorded in Josephus (AD ~90), and the other is recorded in the Protoevangelium of James (an Apocryphal work from the early church, AD ~145). 

To accept the identity as the son of Baruch, you must believe:
* Jesus was prophesying even though he appears to speak in past tense
* No Christians in recorded history throughout the early church recognized this identity of Zechariah (unless you count Origen mistakenly conflating it with the father of John the Baptist)

To accept the identity as the father of John the Baptist, you must believe:
* His father was "Berechiah", even though there's no mention of this anywhere in any kind of historical record
* That the story recording his martyrdom in the temple area from the Protoevangelium of James is accurate (as Origen did)

<h4>Son of Berechiah</h4>

If you hold "son of Berechiah" as the primary identifying mark, you are left with the prophet (Zech 1:1) or the son of Jeberechiah (Isaiah 8:2).

Nothing further is known concerning the son of Jeberechiah in Isaiah 8:2, so let us put him to the side and consider the prophet.

His patronym exactly matches what Jesus said, which carries a lot of weight. However, the only record of him being martyred in the temple area comes from a Rabbinic work several centuries after Christ, and has no support elsewhere.

To accept the identity as the prophet (Zech 1:1), you must believe:
- That he was martyred in the temple area (as the Rabbinic work suggests)

<h4>Martyred between the altar and the temple</h4>

Finally, if you hold the martyrdom in the temple area as the primary identifying mark, you are left with the son of Jehoiada. The record of his death is in inspired scripture, which carries a lot of weight (far more truthworthy than an Apocryphal work, or a Rabbinic work centuries after Christ).

However, the primary issue with the son of Jehoiada is the patronym - how do we explain away the "son of Berechiah"?

To accept the identity as the son of Jehoiada, you must believe one of the following:

* "Berechiah" was another name for "Jehoiada"
    * A pure guess, but supported by Jerome: "Barachiah means 'blessed of the Lord' in our language, and the justice of the priest Jehoiada is shown in the Hebrew language."[^zjero]
* "Berechiah" was a copyist error
    * Despite every major critical edition of the New Testament giving "son of Berechiah" as its preferred reading
* "Son of Jehoiada" really just means "descendent of Jehoiada"
    * Similar to how Ezra 5:1/6:14 refer to "Zechariah the son of Iddo" when he's really the grandson of Iddo (Zechariah 1:1).
    * The difficulty with this approach is that 2 Chronicles 24:22 explicitly says "King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son", not leaving any doubt as to the exact relationship.
* Jesus was using a homiletic device of blending two people into one to enhance the praise of righteous men ("rabbinic name conflation").
    * In the Talmud, the rabbis would blend two people into one, that "the lecturer may in all possible ways enhance the praise of righteous and pious men, and wherever he finds reference in Holy Writ to the worthiness of a particular righteous man he should attribute any other virtue to him which is found in any other outstanding personality, if only this can be given Biblical support, however far-fetched" (Z. H. Chajes in <i>The Student's Guide through the Talmud</i>, Chapter 21, page 172-174)
    * The difficulty with this approach is that while we can grant that this interpretive method was used by rabbinic Judaism more than a century after Christ, what proof is there that this interpretive method existed at the time of Jesus and prior? The proofs usually given have numerous alternative explanations that are far more plausible.
        * The first proof offered is Mark 2:26, where Jesus tells the story recorded in 1 Samuel 21:1-6. However while 1 Samuel 21 identifies the priest as Ahimelech, Mark 2:26 identifies the priest as Abiathar (the son of Ahimelech - 1 Samuel 22:20). Is this an example of this interpretive method? Or was Jesus merely saying "in the time of Abiathar", which is technically correct (1 Samuel 23:6,9)?
        * The second proof offered is the title prefixed to Psalm 34, where Achish (the philistine king with whom David sojourned in 1 Samuel 21:10-22:1) is called Abimelech (the philistine king with whom Abraham and Isaac sojourned in Genesis 20-21, 26). Was this an example of this interpretive method? Or was Achish just his actual name and Abimelech a title (like Pharoah) that he held?

<i>It appears that the order of the Hebrew Bible which has come down to us is the order with which our Lord and His contemporaries were familiar in Palestine. In particular, it appears that Chronicles came at the end of the Bible which they used: when our Lord sums up all the martyrs of Old Testament times He does so by mentioning the first martyr in Genesis (Abel) and the last martyr in Chronicles (Zechariah). (See Lk. xi. 51 with 2 Ch. xxiv. 21). 
[...] The books of the Apocrypha were not included in the Hebrew Bible, nor were they regarded
as canonical by the leaders of official Judaism anywhere. Our Lord and the apostles certainly did not regard the apocryphal books as part of Holy Scripture; the evidence is that they acknowledged as canonical only the books of the Hebrew Bible. and that is the justification for the Protestant Evangelical attitude.</i>

<i>A second saying of Jesus's makes further allusion to the three groups of canonical books. As will be seen in the next chapter, his utterance about all righteous blood from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, which is found in Mat. 23.35 and Luke 11.51, in all probability implies that for Jesus and his hearers the canon began with Genesis and ended with Chronicles, seeing that the murder of Abel is recorded near the beginning of the former book (Gen. 4.3-15) and the murder of Zechariah near the end of the latter book (2 Chron. 24.19-22). This appears to reflect the traditional Jewish arrangement of the books (recorded in the Talmud and discussed below), whereby Chronicles is not placed with Samuel and Kings, in the second group of books, but is put in the third and last group, as its concluding item.</i>

<i>The Jews of the Dispersion used the Septuagint, and the Jews used the Hebraic OT. We can tell this from the fact that Jesus referred to the “blood of Abel” to the “blood of Zechariah,” which was basically giving us the A to Z, the table of contents — Genesis to 2 Chronicles. 2 Chronicles was the last book in their arrangement.

<i>[Gleason Archer] takes the Lord’s statement straight up, and argues that the son of Barachiah was martyred in much the same way as the son of Jehoida was.

The problem with the Latin fathers’ approach is that Jesus really does seem to arguing in an A to Z fashion, and the son of Jehoida [sic: Berechiah] was not a Z.</i>

<i>Jesus affirms the Old Testament books in a few different places. He says in Matthew 23:35, he's rebuking the Jews and He says to them that "on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel" - Abel is from what book in the Bible? Genesis, right? - "to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah whom you murdered between the temple and the altar" - speaking then of the last prophet martyr recorded in the Old Testament.

So I've got the first martyr Abel, to the last martyr of the Old Testament and then at 400 it stops. He doesn't mention any of the Maccabees guys, he doesn't mention any of the other Jews in the next 400 years that died, it's as though these are the only ones in his mind, because they are the bookends of our Old Testament of books. 

So in a sense with that he sort of affirmed that whole Old Testament... That would be Genesis to Malachi.</i>

<i>Jesus implicitly rejected the Apocrypha as Scripture by referring to the entire accepted Jewish Canon of Scripture, “From the blood of Abel [Gen. 4:8] to the blood of Zechariah [2 Chron. 24:20], who was killed between the altar and the house of God; yes, I tell you, it shall be charged against this generation (Lk. 11:51; cf.

Abel was the first martyr in the Old Testament from the book of Genesis, while Zechariah was the last martyr in the book of Chronicles.

For example, all of the 12 minor prophets (Hosea through Malachi) were contained in one book.  This is why there are only 24 books in the Hebrew Bible today.  By Jesus’ referring to Abel and Zachariah, He was canvassing the entire Canon of the Hebrew Scriptures, which included the same 39 books as Protestants accept today.  Therefore, Jesus implicitly rejected the Apocrypha as Scripture.</i>

    <i>Of the blood of Abel the righteous [Matt. 23:35]. Blessed is the memory of Abel... And Zacharias called Jehoiada- for he was a man of two names. And we find also Azariah in the Paralipomene [2 Chronicles 24:20-22], a priest slain between the temple and the altar by king Joash. And who was this Zechariah, of whom he spake until the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah? The first, the father of John [the Baptist], and the prophet, and the other, and a priest of two names, which the scripture also tells us. Which Josephus called Zacharias, who called the name Hellenizing [Josephus, <a href='http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/war4.html#EndNote_War_4.9a'>The War of the Jews, IV.5.4</a>]. 
        
    And this is not Zacharias the son of Berechiah, who was cut in twelve pieces, but the father of John the Baptist. For they that live now under the Saviour cannot remember Zacharias, who was slain in the twelve, but they may, as Josephus said, call Zacharias the father of John. Of whom we have no scriptural evidence, neither that he was the son of Berechiah, nor that the scribes and Pharisees killed him between the temple and the altar. But a certain tradition [<a href='https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0847.htm'>The Protoevangelium of James, 23</a>] has come to us such that there was a certain place at the Temple where it was permitted for virgins to enter and worship God, but they did not allow in that place those who had experienced the bed of a man.

    <i>For the reason is this, and this by tradition is brought down to us, that Zechariah, in the virgin's womb and after the Lord's conception, Zechariah, having made Mary of the land of the virgins was slain between the temple and the altar, being accused by the people as thus making this strange and much-remembered note, born of a virgin, and not corrupted of virginity.</i>

    <i>But, at the risk of drifting far off topic, perhaps it is not untimely that Zechariah who was murdered between the sanctuary and the altar also be cited as testimony to the incorrupt mother. This man Zechariah was a priest, yet not only a priest but also endowed with the gift of prophecy. But the unremarked power of prophecy is proclaimed in the book of the Gospel. When the divine grace was preparing the way so that birth from a virgin not be considered unbelievable by human beings, it used as a preliminary exercise the assent of unbelievers to lesser marvels: a child is born to a barren and elderly woman. This became a prologue for the marvel concerning virginity. For just as it was not by a power of nature that Elizabeth became an infertile mother late in life, but rather the child’s birth is ascribed to the divine will, in the same way too the incredibility of virginal birthpangs gains credibility by reference to the divine. Therefore, since the one born from a barren woman preceded the one born form a virgin, leaping in his mother’s womb at the voice of her who was pregnant with the Lord before he came forth into the light, as soon as the Word’s precursor had come to birth, Zechariah’s silence is broken through prophetic inspiration. And everything Zechariah relates is a prophecy of what is to come. Therefore, since this man was acting as a guide in the prophetic spirit to the knowledge of hidden things, understanding the mystery of virginity at the incorrupt birth, he did not set apart the unmarried mother in the sanctuary of the place set apart for virgins according to the law. He was teaching the Jews that the maker of beings and the king of all creation has, along with all things, his own human nature that is subservient to his own will, and he directs it as he sees fit. He is not ruled by it, since it is in his power to make a new birth that does not remove virginity from the one who becomes a mother. For this reason, Zechariah did not set her apart in the sanctuary of the virgins’ chorus. This place was the intervening space between the sanctuary and the altar. And so when they heard that the king of creation had come forth to human birth in his economy, fearing that people might become servants to the king, they slaughtered the one who testified to these things about the birth, sacrificing the priest at the altar itself!</i> [From Gregory of Nyssa's <a href='https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:13487/'>Oration on the Savior’s Nativity</a>, pages 11-13 [Alternatively available as "In diem natalem Salvatoris" (ed.

[^zjero]: 
    <i>But we do need to ask who this Zechariah son of Barachiah is. For we read about many Zechariahs. He even removes the possibility of error for us by adding: "whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar." I have read diverse things in diverse sources, and I ought to record the opinions of each of these. Some say that Zechariah son of Barachiah is the eleventh of the twelve prophets. The name of his father is in agreement with this, but the Scripture does not say when he was killed between the sanctuary and the altar, chiefly since in his time there were scarcely even ruins of the Temple. Others want this Zechariah to be understood as the father of John. They approve of certain daydreams from apocryphal writings that say that he was killed because he had predicted the Savior’s advent. Since this view does not have the authority of the Scriptures, it is rejected with the same facility with which it is approved. Others want this Zechariah to be the one who was killed between the sanctuary and the altar by Joash king of Judea, as the history of Kings narrates. But one should observe that that Zechariah was not the son of Barachiah, but the son of Jehoiada the priest. This is why the Scripture relates: "Joash did not remember the good deeds of Jehoiada his father, which he had done for him." Since, then, we should also retain Zechariah and the place of the killing is in agreement, we need to ask why he is called the son of Barachiah, and not of Jehoiada. Barachiah means “blessed of the Lord” in our language, and the justice of the priest Jehoiada is shown in the Hebrew language. In the gospel that the Nazarenes use, in place of "son of Barachiah" we have found it written: "son of Jehoiada."</i> [From Jerome's <a href='https://archive.org/details/commentary-on-book-of-st-matthew-st-jerome-f/page/266/mode/2up' target='_blank'>Commentary on Matthew 23:35</a>]


[^zjchr]: 
    <i>But who is this Zacharias? Some say, the father of John; some, the prophet; some, a priest with two different names, whom the Scripture also calls, the son of Jehoiada. But do thou mark this, that the outrage was twofold. For not only did they slay holy men, but also in a holy place. And saying these things, He did not only alarm them, but also comfort His disciples, showing that the righteous men also who were before them suffered these things... For these too slew prophets even in their synagogues, and reverenced neither the place, nor the dignity of the persons. For not merely ordinary persons did they slay, but prophets and wise men, such that they had nothing to lay to their charge. And by these He means the apostles, and those after them, for, indeed, many prophesied... For I will ask them, Did He send the prophets and wise men? Did they slay them in their synagogue? Was their house left desolate? Did all the vengeance come upon that generation? It is quite plain that it was so, and no man gainsays it. As then all these things came to pass, so shall those also come to pass, and most surely they shall submit then.</i> [From John Chrysostom's <a href='https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200174.htm' target='_blank'>Homily 74 on Matthew</a>]

    In the article <a href='https://www.academia.edu/5460261/_The_Blood_from_Abel_to_Zechariah_in_the_History_of_Interpretation_New_Testament_Studies_60_2014_'>The Blood from Abel to Zechariah in the History of Interpretation (2014)</a>, the author notes the following:

    <i>From whatever source Origen derived this tradition, his version of the story became influential among some later Greek Fathers. The same basic approach to the interpretation of Matt 23.25, linking Zechariah son of Barachiah to the father of John the Baptist, appears in Basil of Caesarea, his brother Gregory of Nyssa, and Cyril of Alexandria [Cyril of Alexandria, Comm. in Lucam 11:47, PG 72.720b–721a].</i>

    I was unable to track down this exact resource for Cyril of Alexandria. The closest I came was <a href='https://archive.org/details/acommentaryongo01cyrigoog/page/n32/mode/2up' target='_blank'>this 1859 English translation</a> of Cyril of Alexandria's commentary on the Gospel of Luke, wherein the translator appended this note to the end of Sermon LXXXV:

    <i>In the Syriac the 49th and two following verses are omitted, other instances of which habit of S. Cyril repeatedly occur. In filling up this lacuna, the Catenists first attribute  to him an explanation of v. 49, to the effect that by the prophets whom the wisdom of God sends are meant the apostles, and their successors, the chief pastors of the church: but as the apostles are mentioned by name in the text, there is no reason for making the prophets identical with them in meaning, especially as our Lord was plainly referring to 2 Chron. xxiv. 19 — 21. Next on v. 51, two of Mai's codices C and D assign to Cyril a passage closely resembling, as he remarks, one in Gregory of Nyssa's sermon in diem nat. Domini, and actually referred to him by B, and by Cramer's MS.: and though there are many verbal discrepancies in Gregory's text, yet other portions, especially towards the end, so exactly agree, that there can be no doubt that it is really his. It records an "unwritten tradition," to use Severus' words, to the effect that by Zacharias is meant John Baptist's father, and that he was put to death at the altar for asserting the virginity of Mary, who after her conception had nevertheless taken her place in that part of the temple appropriated to virgins. Upon the Jews wishing to remove her, Zacharias prophesied that she would be the mother of God, and that her offspring would be "God the Saviour Jesus Christ, the King and Ruler of their race." The Jews then in alarm at the prediction of a king, slew Zacharias at the altar. Of such a tradition it is enough to say in the words of Jerome; 'Quia de scripturis non habet auctoritatem, eadem fadlitate contemnitur, qua probatur.' Com. in Mat. xxiii. 35.</i>

    To understand the above translator's note, I found this background information on the text <a href='https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_00_eintro.htm'>in this preface</a>, which says the following:

    <i>Among the manuscripts brought back to the British Library from the Nitrian desert in Egypt by Archdeacon Tattam in 1842, were two volumes containing the Commentary on Luke of Cyril of Alexandria.  This text consisted of a compilation of 156 sermons, although some had suffered damage.  The text had not survived in Greek, although long quotations existed in Byzantine catena-commentaries -- chains of quotations of the Fathers, which had been published by Angelo Mai and by Cramer.
    Robert Payne-Smith produced an edition of the Syriac text [in 1858]. In 1859 he produced an English translation, supplemented from the catenas [which had the note we quoted above]</i>

    So from the above, I conclude Cyril of Alexandria's remarks on the identification of Zechariah in this passage are included in other church father writings where they quote Cyril's commentary on Luke, but was not included in the damaged manuscript of Cyril's commentary on Luke that we recovered in 1842.
    
    I have not (yet) dug into Mai and Cramer's publications of the catenas to confirm this. For now, I accept Robert Payne-Smith's summary of Cyril's position identifying this Zechariah as the father of John the Baptist, as Payne-Smith is a hostile witness (preferring Jerome's identification of Zechariah as the son of Jehoiada).

[^zremig]:
    <i>It should be enquired too how He says, “to the blood of Zacharias,” since the blood of many more saints was afterwards shed. This is thus explained.

[^zaquin]:
    Jerome: Concerning the Abel here spoken of, there is no doubt that it is he whom his brother Cain murdered. He is proved to have been righteous, not only by this judgment of the Lord, but by the passage in Genesis, which says that his offerings were accepted by God. But we must enquire who is this Zacharias, son of Barachias, because we read of many Zachariases; and that we might not mistake, here it is added, “whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.” Some say that it is that Zacharias who is the eleventh among the twelve Prophets, and his father’s name agrees to this, but when he was slain between the temple and the altar, Scripture does not mention; but above all, in his time there were scarce even the ruins of the temple. Others will have it to be Zacharias the father of John.

    Origen: A tradition has come down to us, that there was one place in the temple in which virgins were allowed to worship God, married women being forbidden to stand there. And Mary, after the Saviour’s birth, going into the temple, stood to pray in this place of the virgins. And when they who knew that she had borne a Son were hindering her, Zacharias said, that forasmuch as she was still a virgin, she was worthy of the place of the virgins.

    Whereupon, as though he manifestly were contravening the Law, he was slain there between the temple and the altar by the men of that generation; and thus this word of Christ is true which He spake to those who were standing there, “whom ye slew”.

    Jerome: But as this has no Scripture authority, it is as readily despised as offered. Others will have it to be that Zacharias who was killed by Joas, king of Judah, between the temple and the altar, [2 Chron 24:21] that is, in the court of the temple. But that Zacharias was not the son of Barachias, but of Jehoiada the Priest. But Barachias in our language is interpreted ‘Blessed of the Lord,’ so that the righteousness of Joiada the Priest is expressed by this Hebrew word. But in the Gospel which the Nazarenes use, we find written ‘son of Joiada’ instead of “son of Barachias.”

    Remig.: It should be enquired too how He says, “to the blood of Zacharias,” since the blood of many more saints was afterwards shed. This is thus explained. Abel a keeper of sheep was killed in the field, Zacharias a priest was slain in the court of the temple. The Lord therefore names these two, because by these all holy martyrs are denoted, both of lay and priestly order.

    Chrys.: Moreover, He names Abel, to shew that it would be out of envy that they would kill Christ and His disciples. He names Zacharias, because there was a twofold resemblance in his case, the sacred place, as well as the sacred person.

    Origen: Zacharias is interpreted ‘The memory of God.’ Whosoever then hastes to obliterate the memory of God, seems to those to whom he gives offence to shed the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias. For it is by the blessing of God that we retain the memory of God. Also the memory of God is slain by the wicked, when the Temple of God is polluted by the lustful, and His altar defiled by the carelessness of prayers.

    Abel is interpreted ‘mourning.’ He then who does not receive that, “Blessed are they that mourn,” sheds the blood of Abel, that is, puts away the truth of wholesome mourning.

    Some also shed, as it were, the blood of the Scriptures by putting aside their truth, for all Scripture, if it is not understood according to its truth, is dead.

[^zaquin2]:
    Quis sit iste Abel notum est, quia iste occisus est a Cain fratre suo. Sed iste Zacharias, quis fuerit, non habetur. Legitur quod tres fuerint Zachariae. Quidam filius Barachiae, qui fuit undecimus inter prophetas. Sed de isto non potest intelligi, quia non erat adhuc altare. Alius pater Ioannis, et cuius fuerit filius non invenitur; sed dicit Chrysostomus quod fuit occisus propter Christum, quia in templo erat locus virginum, et cum sederet virgo Maria in loco virginum, expellere voluerunt eam Iudaei a loco; quod prohibuit Zacharias eam defendens, et propter hoc occisus fuit. Alius dicitur filius Ioiadae, quem occidit Ioas in atrio templi, ideo inter templum et altare; unde concordat locus, sed nomen dissonat. Sed tamen dicit Hieronymus quod interpretatur benedictus domini, et designatur sanctitas patris eius Ioiadae sacerdotis. Et dicit quod ipse vidit Evangelium Nazarenorum, et ibi continebatur, filius Ioiadae. Sed quare sub isto Zacharia incipit, potest esse quaestio litteralis. Ratio autem videtur esse, quia etsi praecedentia magis frequentia, ista tamen inveniebantur in Scriptura. Vel aliter, quod Abel pastor, Ioiades sacerdos; ideo per istos duos significantur laici et clerici. Unde omnis poena pro occisione hominum veniet super vos. Vel aliter, quia quidam activi, quidam contemplativi; unde utrique signantur per istos.

    He says that all righteous blood may come upon you, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias. Who this Abel is is known, because he was killed by his brother Cain. But this Zacharias, who he was, is not considered. It is read that there were three Zechariahs. A certain son of Barachias, who was the eleventh among the prophets. But this cannot be understood, because there was not yet an altar. Another father of John, and whose son he was, is not found; but Chrysostom says that he was killed for Christ's sake, because there was a place for virgins in the temple, and when the virgin Mary was sitting in the place of virgins, the Jews wanted to drive her out of the place. which he prevented Zacharias, defending her, and for this he was killed. Another is said to be the son of Joiada, whom Joas killed in the court of the temple, therefore between the temple and the altar; hence the place agrees, but the name disagrees. However, Jerome says that it is interpreted as blessed by the Lord, and signifies the sanctity of his father Joiada the priest. And he says that he himself saw the Gospel of the Nazarenes, and was kept there, the son of Joiada. But why Zechariah begins under this may be a literal question. And the reason seems to be that, although the precedents were more frequent, they were nevertheless found in the Scriptures. Or else, that Abel the shepherd, Joiades the priest; therefore by these two are signified laymen and clerics. Wherefore all punishment for the slaying of men shall come upon you. Or else, because some are active, some contemplative; whence both are signed by them.

    <i>Moreover, He names Abel, to shew that it would be out of envy that they would kill Christ and His disciples. He names Zacharias, because there was a twofold resemblance in his case, the sacred place, as well as the sacred person.</i> [John Chrysostom, as quoted by Thomas Aquinas (AD 1225 - 1274) in <a href='https://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/catena1/catena1.ii.xxiii.html' target='_blank'>Catena Aurea - Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 23</a>]


[^zrjc]:
    To the blood of Zechariah. He does not speak of Zechariah as the latest martyr; for the Jews did not then put an end to the murder of the prophets, but, on the contrary, their insolence and madness increased from that period; and posterity, who followed them, satiated themselves with the blood which their fathers only tasted. Nor is it because his death was better known, though it is recorded in Scripture. But there is another reason, which, though it deserves attention, has escaped the notice of commentators; in consequence of which they have not only fallen into a mistake, but have likewise involved their readers in a troublesome question. We might suppose it to have arisen from forgetfulness on the part of Christ, that, while he mentions one ancient murder, he passes by a prodigious slaughter which afterwards took place under Manasseh. For until the Jews were carried to Babylon, their wicked persecutions of holy men did not cease; and even while they were still under affliction, we know with what cruelty and rage they pursued Jeremiah, (32:2.) But our Lord on purpose abstains from reproaching them with recent murders, and selects this murder, which was more ancient—which was also the commencement and source of base licentiousness, and afterwards led them to break out into unbounded cruelty—because it was more suitable to his design. For I have lately explained, that his leading object was to show that this nation, as it did not desist from impiety, must be held guilty of all the murders which had been perpetrated during a long period. Not only, therefore, does he denounce the punishment of their present cruelty, but says that they must be called to account for the murder of Zechariah, as if their own hands had been imbrued in his blood.

    There is no probability in the opinion of those who refer this passage to that Zechariah who exhorted the people, after their return from the Babylonish captivity, to build the temple, (Zechariah 8:9,) and whose prophecies are still in existence. For though the title of the book informs us that he was the son of Barachiah, (Zechariah 1:1,) yet we nowhere read that he was slain; and it is, forced exposition to say, that he was slain during the period that intervened between the building of the altar and of the temple. But as to the other Zechariah, son of Jehoiada, the sacred history relates what agrees perfectly with this passage; that when true religion had fallen into decay, after the death of his father, through the wicked revolt of the king and of the people, the Spirit of God came upon him, to reprove severely the public idolatry, and that on this account he was stoned in the porch of the temple, (2 Chronicles 24:20, 21.) There is no absurdity in supposing that his father Jehoiada received, in token of respect, the surname of Barachiah, because, having throughout his whole life defended the true worship, he might justly be pronounced to be the Blessed of God. But whether Jehoiada had two names, or whether (as Jerome thinks) there is a mistake in the word, there can be no doubt as to the fact, that Christ refers to that impious stoning of Zechariah which is recorded in 2 Chronicles 24:21, 22

    Whom you slew between the temple and the altar. The crime is rendered still more heinous by the circumstance of the place, since they did not revere the sacredness of the temple. Here the temple is put for the outer court, as in other passages. Near it was the altar of burnt offerings, (1 Kings 8:64; 18:30,) so that the priest offered the sacrifices in presence of the people. It is evident, therefore, that there must have been furious rage, when the sight of the altar and of the temple could not restrain the Jews from profaning that sacred place by a detestable murder.</i>

[^zjlig]:
    <i>That the discourse here is concerning Zacharias the son of Jehoiada, killed by king Joash, we make appear by these arguments:
    I. Because no other Zacharias is said to have been slain before these words were spoken by Christ. Those things that are spoke of Zacharias, the father of the Baptist, are dreams; and those of Zacharias, one of the twelve prophets, are not much better. The killing of our Zacharias in the Temple is related in express words: and why, neglecting this, should we seek for another, which in truth we shall nowhere find in any author of good credit?
    II. The Jews observe, that the death of this Zacharias, the son of Jehoiada, was made memorable by a signal character [nota] and revenge: of the martyrdom of the other Zacharias they say nothing at all.
    ...I suppose that Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah in Isaiah [Isaiah 8:2] is the very same with our Zacharias the son of Jehoiada
    ...Objection. But since our Saviour took examples from the Old Testament, why did he not rather say, "from the blood of Abel to the blood of Uriah the priest?" that is, from the beginning of the world to the end of the first Temple? I answer,
    1. The killing of Zechariah was more horrible, as he was more high in dignity; and as the place wherein he was killed was more holy.
    2. The consent of the whole people as more universal to his death.
    3. He was a more proper and apparent type of Christ.
    4. The requiring of vengeance is mentioned only concerning Abel and Zechariah: "Behold, the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me." [Genesis 4:10] And, "Let the Lord look upon it, and require it." [2 Chronicles 24:22]
    5. In this the death of Christ agrees exactly with the death of Zechariah; that, although the city and nation of the Jews did not perish till about forty years after the death of Christ, yet they gave themselves their death's wound in wounding Christ. So it was also in the case of Zechariah: Jerusalem and the people of the Jews stood indeed many years after the death of Zechariah, but from that time began to sink, and draw towards ruin. Consult the story narrowly, and you will plainly find, that all the affairs of the Jews began to decline and grow worse and worse, from that time when "blood touched blood," (the blood of the sacrificer mingled with the blood of the sacrifice), and when "the people became contentious and rebellious against the priest."</i>
    [From John Lightfoot's <a href='https://ccel.org/ccel/lightfoot/talmud/talmud.i.xiv.html' target='_blank'>From the Talmud and Hebraica</a>, Matthew, Chapter 23, Section 35]

[^zjlig2]:
    <i>If our Saviour had not in the evangelist St. Matthew added "the son of Barachias," no one could have doubted that it referred to any other than Zacharias the son of Jehoiada, whose slaughter is recorded 2 Chronicles 24. It is certain the Jews own no other Zacharias slain in the Temple but himself...
    And however a great part of it in these relations of theirs may be mere flourish, yet by the whole framing of the thing, it must needs be observed, that the slaughter of this Zacharias was so famous and rooted in the minds of that people generally, that when our Saviour speaks of one Zacharias, slain between the Temple and the altar, it cannot be imagined that they could understand him pointing at any other than this very man. As for his father being here called Barachias, and not Jehoiada, we have spoken to that matter elsewhere...
    If any one hesitate about the changing of the name, let him say by what name he finds Jehoiada recited in that catalogue of priests set down in 1 Chronicles 6. It must be either some other name, or else we must suppose him wholly left out of that number. If by another name, you will say (supposing he be also called Barachias) he was then a man of three names. This indeed is no unusual thing with that nation for some to have more names than one: nay, if you will believe the Jewish doctors, even Moses himself had no less than ten.</i>

[^zjdm]: 
    <i>Now it appears from 1 Chron. xxiv. 20 — 22. that Zacharias, who was slain between the temple and the altar, was the son, not of Barachias, but of Jehoiada: consequently if the account in the Chronicles be accurate, the reading Barachias at Matth. xxiii. 35. cannot be the true reading. Some commentators have had recourse to the supposition that Jehoiada and Barachias were different names of the same person: but this assertion is wholly incapable of proof, and is in itself highly improbable. Wetftein conjectures that St. Matthew purposely avoided the use of the word Jehoiada, because it contained in it the abbreviated name of Jehova, and therefore substituted Barachia. But this caution in respect to the abbreviation [?] was confined only to the number 15, which it is true the Jews never noted by [?] though Jod is 10, and He is 5. And even if this reverence for [?] extended to proper names, Wetftein's solution would be unsatisfactory, for in the Hebrew these two letters occur together in Barachia, as well as in Jehoiada. That Zacharias the eleventh of the the minor prophets, who was son of Barachias, was murdered, we read no where: and it is not probable that two different perfons named Zacharias, should both of them have been murdered under the very same circumstances. But if we admit that the eleventh of the minor prophets fell a sacrifice to the Jews, as well as the son of Jehoiada, yet Christ would rather have instanced the son of Jehoiada, because the murder of this person was not only particularly known, but was supposed to call aloud for vengeance. The blood therefore of this Zacharias was more properly mentioned with the blood of Abel, than the blood of another Zacharias, whose murder, even if he did fall a victim, was unknown.</i>

    <i>The order in which the writings of the Old Testament now follow each other appears to be of extreme antiquity. Jesus Sirach the elder reckons out of the Old Testament the famous men, who deserve the esteem of posterity, in the very same order in which they succeed one another in our editions : the twelve lesser Prophets he throws together in one book and places it after Ezekiel (Sirach xlv.- xlix.). According to the New Testament, in the manuscripts of that day the series of Hagiographa commenced with the Psalms and the book of Chronicles closed the entire collection. For Christ uses the term Hagiographa of the Psalms, which He names as the first book thereof (Luke xxiv. 44 3 ) ; and when He wishes to cite the first and last instances of the shedding of innocent blood, from the history of the Old Testament, <u>He chooses the example of that of Abel from Genesis as the first book of the Old Testament, and that of Zachariah from the book of Chronicles as the last book of all (Matthew xxiii. 35).</u> </i>

    <i>But this especially for you to learn 
    is fitting: not every book is safe 
    which has acquired the venerable name of Scripture. 
    For there appear from time to time pseudonymous 
    books, some of which are intermediate or neighbours, 
    as one might say, to the words of Truth, 
    while others are spurious and utterly unsafe, 
    like counterfeit and spurious coins 
    which bear the king's inscription, 
    but as regards their material are base forgeries. 
    For this reason I will state for you the divinely inspired 
    books one by one, so that you may learn them clearly. 
    I will first recite those of the Old Testament. 
    The Pentateuch has Creation, then Exodus, 
    and Leviticus, the middle book, 
    after which is Numbers, then Deuteronomy. 
    Add to these Joshua, and Judges, 
    then Ruth, and of Kingdoms the four 
    books, and the double team of Chronicles; 
    after these, Esdras, one and then the second. 
    Then I would review for you five in verse: 
    Job, crowned in the contests of many sufferings, 
    and the Book of Psalms, soothing remedy for the soul, 
    three of Solomon the Wise: Proverbs, 
    Ecclesiastes, Canticle of Canticles. 
    Add to these the Prophets Twelve, 
    Hosea first, then Amos the second, 
    Micah, Joel, Obadiah, and the type 
    of Him who three days suffered, Jonah, 
    Nahum after those, and Habakkuk; and ninth, 
    Zephaniah, Haggai, and Zechariah, 
    and twice-named angel Malachi. 
    After these prophets learn yet another four: 
    The great and fearless Isaiah, 
    the sympathetic Jeremiah, and mysterious 
    Ezekiel, and finally Daniel, 
    most wise in his deeds and words. 
    With these, some approve the inclusion of Esther. 
    Time now for me to recite the books of the New Testament. 
    Accept only four Evangelists, 
    Matthew, then Mark, to which Luke as third 
    add; count John in time as 
    fourth, but first in sublimity of dogma. 
    Son of Thunder rightly he is called, 
    who loudly sounded forth the Word of God. 
    Accept from Luke a second book also, 
    that of the catholic Acts of the Apostles. 
    Add to these besides that Chosen Vessel, 
    Herald of the Gentiles, the Apostle 
    Paul, writing in wisdom to the churches 
    twice seven epistles, one to the Romans, 
    to which must be added two to the Corinthians, 
    and that to the Galatians, and to the Ephesians, 
    after which there is the one to the Philippians, then those written 
    to the Colossians, to the Thessalonians two, 
    two to Timothy, and to Titus and Philemon 
    one each, and to the Hebrews one. 
    Some call that to the Hebrews spurious, 
    but they say it not well; for the grace is genuine. 
    What then is left? Of the Catholic epistles 
    some say seven, others only three 
    must be accepted: one of James, 
    one of Peter, one of John, 
    otherwise three of John, and with them two 
    of Peter, and also Jude's, the seventh. 
    The Apocalypse of John, again, 
    some approve, but most 
    will call it spurious. This would be the most unerring 
    canon of the divinely inspired scriptures.</i>

    <i>By the time of the captives' return from Babylon these Jews had acquired the following books and prophets, and the following books of the prophets: 1. Genesis. 2. Exodus. 3. Leviticus. 4. Numbers. 5. Deuteronomy. 6. The Book of Joshua the son of Nun. 7. The Book of the Judges. 8. Ruth. 9. Job. 10. The Psalter. 11. The Proverbs of Solomon. 12. Ecclesiastes. 13. The Song of Songs. 14. The First Book of Kings. 15. The Second Book of Kings. 16. The Third Book of Kings. 17. The Fourth Book of Kings. 1 18. The First Book of Chronicles. 19. The Second Book of Chronicles. 20. The Book of the Twelve Prophets. 21. The Prophet Isaiah. 22. The Prophet Jeremiah, with the Lamentations and the Epistles of Jeremiah and Baruch. 23. The Prophet Ezekiel. 24. The Prophet Daniel. 25. I Ezra. 26. II Ezra. 2 27. Esther. These are the twenty-seven books given the Jews by God. They are counted as twenty-two, however, like the letters of their Hebrew alphabet, because ten books which (Jews) reckon as five are double. But I have explained this clearly elsewhere. And they have two more books of disputed canonicity, the Wisdom of Sirach and the Wisdom of Solomon, apart from certain other apocrypha. All these sacred books taught (them) Judaism and Law's observances till the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> [From Epiphanius of Salamis' <a href='https://archive.org/stream/ThePanarionOfEpiphaniusOfSalamis_201603/the%20panarion%20of%20epiphanius%20of%20salamis#page/n69/mode/2up' target='_blank'>Panarion (also called Against Heresies) viii. 6</a>, <a href='http://www.bible-researcher.com/epiphanius.html'>another source</a>]

    <i>Therefore in this manner the books also are counted as twenty-two; but there are twenty-seven, because five of them are double. For Ruth is joined to Judges, and they are counted among the Hebrews (as) one book. The first (book) of Kingdoms is joined to the second and called one book; the third is joined to the fourth and becomes one book. First Paraleipomena is joined to Second and called one book. The first book of Ezra is joined to the second and becomes one book. So in this way the books are grouped into four "pentateuchs," and there are two others left over, so that the books of the (Old) Testament are as follows: the five of the Law---- Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy----this is the Pentateuch, otherwise the code of law; and five in verse----the book of Job, then of the Psalms, the Proverbs of Solomon, Koheleth, the Song of Songs. Then another "pentateuch" (of books) which are called the Writings, and by some the Hagiographa, which are as follows: Joshua the (son) of Nun, the book of Judges with Ruth, First and Second Paraleipomena, First and Second Kingdoms, Third and Fourth Kingdoms; and this is a third "pentateuch." Another "pentateuch" is the books of the prophets----the Twelve Prophets (forming) one book, Isaiah one, Jeremiah one, Ezekiel one, Daniel one ----and again the prophetic "pentateuch" is filled up. But there remain two other books, which are (one of them) the two of Ezra that are counted as one, and the other the book of Esther. So twenty-two books are completed according to the number of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrews. For there are two (other) poetical books, that by Solomon called "Most Excellent," and that by Jesus the son of Sirach and grandson of Jesus---- for his grandfather was named Jesus (and was) he who composed Wisdom in Hebrew, which his grandson, translating, wrote in Greek----which also are helpful and useful, but are not included in the number of the recognized; and therefore they were not kept in the chest, that is, in the ark of the covenant.</i> [From Epiphanius of Salamis' <a href='https://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/epiphanius_weights_03_text.htm#C4' target='_blank'>Weights and Measures, 4</a>]

    <i>The divine oracles should always on the tongue and in the mind be rehearsed. For God will indeed give a reward for this labor, so that you may obtain light from anything hidden, or, what is far better, that you may be spurred by God to greater purity, and thirdly, be called away from the cares of the world by such study. But let not extraneous books seduce your mind. For many malignant writings have been disseminated. Accept, o friend, this my approved number. These are all twelve of the historical books, of the most ancient Hebrew wisdom: First there is Genesis, then Exodus, Leviticus too. Then Numbers, and the Second Law. Then Joshua and Judges. Ruth is eighth. The ninth and tenth books [are] the acts of Kings, and [the eleventh is] Chronicles. Last you have Ezra. The poetic books are five: Job being first, then [the Psalms of] David; and three of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Canticles and Proverbs. And similarly five of prophetic inspiration. There are the Twelve written in one book: Hosea and Amos, and Micah the third; then Joel, and Jonah, Obadiah, Nahum also, and Habakkuk, and Zephaniah, Haggai, then Zechariah, and Malachi. All these are one. The second is of Isaiah. Then the one called as an infant, Jeremiah, Then Ezekiel, and the gift of Daniel. I count therefore, twenty-two of the ancient books, corresponding to the number of the Hebrew letters.</i> [From Gregory of Nazianzus' <a href='http://www.bible-researcher.com/gregory.html' target='_blank'>Concerning the Genuine Books of Divinely Inspired Scripture</a>]

[^cljerm]:
    <i>The first book is called among them Bresith, which we call Genesis; the second, Hellesmoth, which is named Exodus; the third, Vaiecra, that is Leviticus; the fourth Vaiedabber, which we call Numbers; the fifth, Addebarim, which is designated Deuteronomy. These are the five books of Moses, which they appropropriately call Thorat, that is, the Law.
    
    The second order is made of the Prophets, and begins with Jesus son of Nave, which is called among them Joshua benNum. Then they append Sopthim, that is the book of Judges; and they attach Ruth to the same, because the history narrated happened in the days of the Judges. Samuel follows third, which we call First and Second Kingdoms. Fourth is Malachim, that is Kings, which book contains Third and Fourth Kingdoms; and it is much better to say Malachim, that is Kings, rather than Malachoth, that is Kingdoms, for it does not describe the kingdoms of many nations, but only that of the Israelite people which contains twelve tribes. Fifth is Isaiah, sixth Jeremiah, seventh Ezekiel, eighth the book of the Twelve Prophets, which is called Thareasra among them.

    The third order holds the Hagiographa, and begins with Job, the first book, the second by David, which is also one book of Psalms comprising five sections. The third is Solomon, having three books: Proverbs, which they call Parables, that is Masaloth, and Ecclesiastes, that is Accoeleth, and The Song of Songs, which they denote with the title Sirassirim. Sixth is Daniel, seventh Dabreiamin, that is Words of the Days, which we may call more clearly a chronicle (Gk here: χρονικον) of all of Divine history, which book is written among us as First and Second Paralipomenon; eighth is Ezra, which is also in the same manner among Greeks and Latins divided into two books; ninth is Esther.

    And thus there are likewise twenty-two books in the Old (Testament), that is five of Moses, eight of the Prophets, nine of the Hagiographa. Although some may write Ruth and Cinoth among the Hagiographa, and think of counting these books among their number, and then by this to have twenty-four books of the Old Law, which the Apocalypse of John introduces with the number of twenty-four elders worshipping the Lamb and offering their crowns, prostrated on their faces, and crying out with unwearying voice: "Holy, holy, holy Lord God almighty, Who was and Who is, and Who will be."</i>

[^claug]:
    <i>Now the whole canon of Scripture on which we say this judgment is to be exercised, is contained in the following books:— Five books of Moses, that is, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; one book of Joshua the son of Nun; one of Judges; one short book called Ruth, which seems rather to belong to the beginning of Kings; next, four books of Kings, and two of Chronicles— these last not following one another, but running parallel, so to speak, and going over the same ground. The books now mentioned are history, which contains a connected narrative of the times, and follows the order of the events. There are other books which seem to follow no regular order, and are connected neither with the order of the preceding books nor with one another, such as Job, and Tobias, and Esther, and Judith, and the two books of Maccabees, and the two of Ezra, which last look more like a sequel to the continuous regular history which terminates with the books of Kings and Chronicles. Next are the Prophets, in which there is one book of the Psalms of David; and three books of Solomon, viz., Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes. For two books, one called Wisdom and the other Ecclesiasticus, are ascribed to Solomon from a certain resemblance of style, but the most likely opinion is that they were written by Jesus the son of Sirach. Still they are to be reckoned among the prophetical books, since they have attained recognition as being authoritative. The remainder are the books which are strictly called the Prophets: twelve separate books of the prophets which are connected with one another, and having never been disjoined, are reckoned as one book; the names of these prophets are as follows:— Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi; then there are the four greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezekiel. The authority of the Old Testament is contained within the limits of these forty-four books.</i> [From Augustine's <a href='http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/12022.htm' target='_blank'>On Christian Doctrine, Book II, Chapter 8, Section 13</a>]

    <i>The Hebrews take the Old Testament, with Ezra as its redactor, as consisting of twenty-two books, corresponding to the number of letters in their alphabet. They divide these books into three classes: Law, Prophets, and Sacred Writings. 4. The first class, Law (Lex), is taken as being five books: of these the first is Bresith,1 which is Genesis; second Veelle Semoth, which is Exodus; third Vaiicra, which is Leviticus; fourth Vaiedabber, which is Numbers; fifth Elleaddebarim, which is Deuteronomy.

    5. These are the five books of Moses, which the Hebrews call Torah (Thora), and Latin speakers call the Law. That which was given through Moses is properly called the Law.

    6. The second class is of Prophets (Propheta), in which are contained eight books, of which the first is Josua Benun, called Iesu Nave in Latin (i.e. the book of Joshua ‘ben Nun,’ the son of Nun). The second is Sophtim, which is Judges; third Samuel, which is First Kings; fourth Malachim, which is Second Kings; fifth Isaiah; sixth Jeremiah; seventh Ezekiel; eighth Thereazar, which is called the Twelve Prophets, whose books are taken as one because they have been joined together since they are short. 

    7. The third class is of Sacred Writings (Hagiographa), that is, of ‘those writing about holy things’, in which there are nine books: first Job; second the Psalter; third Masloth, which is the Proverbs of Solomon; fourth Coheleth, which is Ecclesiastes; fifth Sir hassirim, which is the Song of Songs; sixth Daniel; seventh Dibre haiamim, which means ‘words of the days’ (verba dierum), that is Paralipomenon (i.e. Chronicles); eighth Ezra; ninth Esther. All together these books – five, eight, and nine – make up the twenty-two as was reckoned above. 

    8. Some add Ruth and Cinoth, which in Latin is the Lamentations (Lamentatio) of Jeremiah, to the Sacred Writings, and make twenty-four books of the Old Testament, corresponding to the twenty-four Elders who stand present before the face of God (Apocalypse 4:4, etc.)</i>

    <i>Observe, further , that there are two and twenty books of the Old Testament, one for each letter of the Hebrew tongue. For there are twenty-two letters of which five are double, and so they come to be twenty-seven. For the letters Caph, Mem, Nun, Pe , Sade are double. And thus the number of the books in this way is twenty-two, but is found to be twenty-seven because of the double character of five. For Ruth is joined on to Judges, and the Hebrews count them one book: the first and second books of Kings are counted one: and so are the third and fourth books of Kings: and also the first and second of Paraleipomena: and the first and second of Esdra. In this way, then, the books are collected together in four Pentateuchs and two others remain over, to form thus the canonical books. Five of them are of the Law, viz. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. This which is the code of the Law, constitutes the first Pentateuch. Then comes another Pentateuch, the so-called Grapheia , or as they are called by some, the Hagiographa, which are the following: Jesus the Son of Nave , Judges along with Ruth, first and second Kings, which are one book, third and fourth Kings, which are one book, and the two books of the Paraleipomena which are one book. This is the second Pentateuch. The third Pentateuch is the books in verse, viz. Job, Psalms, Proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiastes of Solomon and the Song of Songs of Solomon. The fourth Pentateuch is the Prophetical books, viz the twelve prophets constituting one book, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel. Then come the two books of Esdra made into one, and Esther. There are also the Panaretus, that is the Wisdom of Solomon, and the Wisdom of Jesus, which was published in Hebrew by the father of Sirach, and afterwards translated into Greek by his grandson, Jesus, the Son of Sirach.
