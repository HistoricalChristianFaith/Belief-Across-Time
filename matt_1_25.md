<h1>The Argument - "heos"</h1>

In Matthew 1:25, the scriptures tell us that Joseph took his wife Mary, but "but knew her not until [Greek: heos] she had given birth to a son."

The word "until" (heos) implies a fixed and definite time, and when that is fulfilled, the event takes place which previously did not take place. So after Mary gave birth to Jesus, Joseph began having marital relations with her - this is the most natural reading of this verse. 

Therefore, Mary did not remain a virgin, is not a perpetual virgin, and indeed had other sons and daughters with Joseph.

<h2>Difficulties With The "heos" Argument</h2>

The argument postulates that the word "until" (heos) should be interpreted to mean "not X until Y, after which X ensues" - in this instance, that would mean "did not know her until she gave birth to a son, and then knew her".

However there are numerous examples in the scriptures of this word "heos" being used, which if interpreted that way result in nonsense:

Matthew 28:20 says, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto [heos] the end of the world." Does this imply the Lord will forsake His disciples after the end of the world?

1 Corinthians 15:25 says, "For he must reign, till [heos] he has put all enemies under his feet." Does this imply the Lord will reign only until His enemies begin to be under His feet, and once they are under His feet He will cease to reign?

Similar nonsense appears in the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament) for Isaiah 46:4, Psalm 123:2, 2 Samuel 6:23, Genesis 8:7, and Deuteronomy 34:6.

An alternative interpretation, which fits the evidence from these other verses, is that "heos" can simply mean  "until (and continuing)". Applied to Matthew 1:25, it's a valid interpretation that Joseph did not know Mary until she gave birth to Jesus, and then continued not knowing her.

This argument was first proposed by Helvidius around AD 383, but was immediately shut down by Jerome. 

## Helvidius (AD ~383)[^hmotf]
<blockquote>
<i>...the adverb till implies a fixed and definite time, and when that is fulfilled, he says the event takes place which previously did not take place, as in the case before us, "and knew her not till she had brought forth a son." It is clear that she was known after she brought forth, and that that knowledge was only delayed by her engendering a son. [...] Why could not Scripture say, as it said of Thamar and Judah, [Genesis 38:26] 'And he took his wife, and knew her again no more'? Could not Matthew find words to express his meaning? 'He knew her not,' he says, 'until she brought forth a son.' He did then, after her delivery, know her, whom he had refrained from knowing until she was delivered.</i>

## Jerome (AD 383)[^jmotf]
<blockquote>
<i>Our reply is briefly this — the words knew and till in the language of Holy Scripture are capable of a double meaning. As to the former, he himself gave us a dissertation to show that it must be referred to sexual intercourse, and no one doubts that it is often used of the knowledge of the understanding, as, for instance, "the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem, and his parents knew it not." Now we have to prove that just as in the one case he has followed the usage of Scripture, so with regard to the word till he is utterly refuted by the authority of the same Scripture, which often denotes by its use a fixed time (he himself told us so), frequently time without limitation, as when God by the mouth of the prophet says to certain persons, [Isaiah 46:4] "Even to old age I am he." Will He cease to be God when they have grown old? And the Saviour in the Gospel tells the Apostles, [Matthew 28:20] "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world." Will the Lord then after the end of the world has come forsake His disciples, and at the very time when seated on twelve thrones they are to judge the twelve tribes of Israel will they be bereft of the company of their Lord? Again Paul the Apostle writing to the Corinthians says, "Christ the first-fruits, afterward they that are Christ's, at his coming. Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet." Granted that the passage relates to our Lord's human nature, we do not deny that the words are spoken of Him who endured the cross and is commanded to sit afterwards on the right hand. What does he mean then by saying, "for he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet"? Is the Lord to reign only until His enemies begin to be under His feet, and once they are under His feet will He cease to reign? Of course His reign will then commence in its fullness when His enemies begin to be under His feet. David also in the fourth Song of Ascents speaks thus, "Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us." Will the prophet, then, look unto the Lord until he obtain mercy, and when mercy is obtained will he turn his eyes down to the ground? Although elsewhere he says, "My eyes fail for your salvation, and for the word of your righteousness." I could accumulate countless instances of this usage, and cover the verbosity of our assailant with a cloud of proofs; I shall, however, add only a few, and leave the reader to discover like ones for himself... And in the same way must we interpret what we are told concerning Joseph. The Evangelist pointed out a circumstance which might have given rise to some scandal, namely, that Mary was not known by her husband until she was delivered, and he did so that we might be the more certain that she from whom Joseph refrained while there was room to doubt the import of the vision was not known after her delivery.</i>

For the next millenium, there was broad agreement that Helvidius' argument was bunk:

* <b>Epiphanius of Salamis (AD 403):</b> "For I have heard from someone that certain persons are venturing to say that she had marital relations after the Savior's birth. And I am not surprised. The ignorance of persons who do not know the sacred scriptures well and have not consulted histories..." [^epipmotf]
* <b>Chromatius of Aquileia (AD 406):</b> "But concerning what the Evangelist said, 'And he did not know her till she had borne her firstborn son,' not a few careless people insist on asking whether after the Lord’s birth the holy mother Mary had relations with Joseph. But this is not admissible on the grounds of either faith or truth..." [^chrommotf]
* <b>John Chrysostom (AD 407):</b> "He has here used the word 'till,' not that you should suspect that afterwards he did know her, but to inform you that before the birth the Virgin was wholly untouched by man." [^jcymotf]
* <b>Augustine (AD 430):</b> "Those heretics were called Antidicomarites who denied the virginity of Mary to the point that they claim that after the birth of Christ she had intercourse with her husband." [^augmotf]
* <b>John Damascene (AD 749):</b> "And the word 'till' signifies the limit of the appointed time but does not exclude the time thereafter. For the Lord says, And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world, not meaning thereby that He will be separated from us after the completion of the age." [^jodamotf]
* <b>Theophylact of Ohrid (AD 1107):</b> "'Until' here does not mean that before the birth he did not know her and afterwards he did, but that he absolutely never knew her. Scripture employs this expression... Again, 'I am with you until the end of the world' (Gen 28:20). So after the end He will no longer be with the saints? But how can that be? For at that time more than ever will He be with them. So must you understand here 'until she brought forth' to mean, neither before the birth nor after the birth did he know her." [^toomotf]
* <b>Thomas Aquinas (AD 1270):</b> "Without any hesitation we must abhor the error of Helvidius, who dared to assert that Christ's Mother, after His Birth, was carnally known by Joseph, and bore other children." [^tamotf]
* <b>Martin Luther (AD 1523):</b> "They interpret it [Matt. 1:25] as though the evangelist meant to say that he knew her, but not before she had brought forth her first-born son. This was the view of Helvidius which was refuted by Jerome. Such carnal interpretations miss the meaning and purpose of the evangelist... this babble of Helvidius is without justification; in addition, he has neither noticed nor paid any attention to either Scripture or the common idiom" [^mlmotf]
* <b>John Calvin (AD 1562):</b> "There have been certain folk who have wished to suggest that from this passage (Matt 1:25) that the Virgin Mary had other children than the Son of God, and that Joseph then dwelt with her later; but what folly this is! For the gospel writer did not wish to record what happened afterwards; he simply wished to make clear Joseph's obedience and to show also that Joseph had been well and truly assured that it was God who had sent His angel to Mary." [^jcmotf]
* <b>J.B. Lightfoot (AD 1865):</b> "Certain expressions in the evangelical narratives are said to imply that Mary bore other children besides the Lord, and it is even asserted that no unprejudiced person could interpret them otherwise. The justice of this charge may be fairly questioned. The context in each case seems to suggest another explanation of these expressions, which does not decide anything one way or the other... St. Matthew’s expression however, ‘till she brought forth,’ [Matthew 1:25] as appears from the context, is intended simply to show that Jesus was not begotten in the course of nature; and thus, while it denies any previous intercourse with her husband, it neither asserts nor implies any subsequent intercourse." [^ligf]

<h1>The New Argument - "heos hou"</h1>

In recent times, this argument has been modified to sidestep Jerome's rebuttal. The revised version of the argument is as follows:

In Matthew 1:25, the scriptures tell us that Joseph took his wife Mary, but "but knew her not until [Greek: heos hou] she had given birth to a son."

It is true that the Greek word "heos" can mean "until (and continuing)" - however that is irrelevant for interpreting Matthew 1:25, as this passage uses the more specific "heos hou" rather than just "heos" alone.

To determine the meaning of "heos hou", we must examine the 17 times this phrase is used throughout the New Testament. Two of those times it simply means "while". Of the remaining 15, it never means "until (and continuing)" - in each case, the passage of scripture requires the meaning "until a specified time (but not after)".

Therefore, Jerome's counterexamples are all invalid, as they all use the word "heos" alone (and not "heos hou" like this passage). The phrase "heos hou" implies a fixed and definite time, and when that is fulfilled, the event takes place which previously did not take place. So after Mary gave birth to Jesus, Joseph began having marital relations with her. 

Therefore, Mary did not remain a virgin, is not a perpetual virgin, and indeed had other sons and daughters with Joseph.

<h2>Difficulties With The "heo hou" Argument</h2>

<h3>The Sandwich Problem</h3>

One thing the argument doesn't sufficiently address is how "heos hou" can mean one thing shortly before the New Testament era, and again the same thing shortly after, but something different in the middle.

The argument solely determines the meaning of "heos hou" in Matthew 1:25 from 15 examples in New Testament usage. 

However, shortly before the time of Christ the Septuagint translation was made - this was the translation that Jesus, the New Testament authors, and the early church used as their Bible. In this translation, there are numerous instances where "heos hou" explicitly means "until (and continuing)". Some examples are Psalm 71[72]:7, Psalm 93[94]:14-15, Psalm 111[112]:8, and 2 Chron 29:28.

Shortly after the New Testament era, we see John Chrysostom give a homily in Greek on Matthew[^jcymotf], wherein he quotes Matthew 1:25 with "heos hou", but then asks the question of why Matthew used the word "heos"... as though he were unaware of any difference between "heos" and "heos hou".

When pressed to explain this, the main proponent of this argument <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20071008230306/http:/www.ntrmin.org/where_have_all_the_critics_gone.htm' target='_blank'>responded as follows</a>:
> Yes, the Septuagint was "in place roughly two hundred years before Christ," which is one reason it is irrelevant to the discussion. As I mentioned in my responses to Sungenis (for which, see the links above), the approach to Greek grammar that states we should trace a word or phrase throughout the Classical period, the Hellenistic period, and the Modern period, and then roll all the meanings we find into one neat little package called a “semantic range,” has been roundly rejected by modern Greek scholarship. That approach (known as the diachronic approach), practiced by Greek grammarians in the nineteenth century, has been shown time and again to be deficient due to its neglect in taking into account the phenomenon D.A. Carson calls semantic obsolescence, according to which any word or phrase in the Greek language (or any other language, for that matter) is susceptible to etymological changes, many of which occur in very short order even within the same language period (for more information on this phenomenon, see Carson’s Exegetical Fallacies). That is why one cannot simply bypass the established usage of the era in which a word or phrase occurs (as Tacelli has done in his article), reach 250 years into the past—or worse, the same amount of time into the future!—and pronounce a verdict on what a word could have meant in an era in which it demonstrably did not mean that...
> 
> Such an observation will doubtless hold emotional appeal to those who are a priori committed to the authority of Chrysostom; but for purposes of New Testament Greek grammar, Chrysostom’s writings are completely irrelevant. How many grammarians today turn to Chrysostom (or indeed to any fourth-century writing) to establish usage for the New Testament era? Did Chrysostom know about semantic obsolescence? Did he examine every occurrence of this phrase in the literature of the first century and surrounding centuries? Of course not. And to claim, as Tacelli does, that Chrysostom was “sensitive to [the Greek language’s] every nuance” is so outlandish as to be laughable. Was Chrysostom aware of Granville Sharp’s rule regarding the article governing two nouns in regimen? Was he familiar with Colwell’s rule regarding definite predicate nouns? How about McGaughy’s rule regarding einai connecting two substantives? Or how about Goetchius’ qualifications of McGaughy’s rule? What about Porter’s aspectual theory? Or the Moeller/Kramer rule regarding consecutive accusative substantives? Or Reed’s qualifications of Moeller/Kramer? If Chrysostom was familiar with “every nuance” of Greek, where is the evidence of this?

Having no background in Greek, I cannot further interact with the response above - it's either legitimate and convincing, or just a form of technobabble, take your pick.

<h3>The New Testament Problem</h3>

The argument states:
> To determine the meaning of "heos hou", we must examine the 17 times this phrase is used throughout the New Testament. Two of those times it simply means "while". Of the remaining 15, it never means "until (and continuing)" - in each case, <b>the passage of scripture requires the meaning "until a specified time (but not after)".</b>

The fifteen verses in question are Matt 1:25, Matt 13:33, Matt 17:9, Matt 18:34, Luke 13:21, Luke 15:8, Luke 22:18, Luke 24:49, John 13:38, Acts 21:26, Acts 23:12, Acts 23:14, Acts 23:21, Acts 25:21, and 2 Peter 1:19.

Do those 15 usages actually require the meaning "until a specified time (but not after)"?

<h4>Matthew 1:25</h4>

Clearly Matthew 1:25 does not necessarily <b>require</b> the meaning "until a specified time (but not after)" - that's what the argument is trying to prove!

<h4>2 Peter 1:19</h4>

2 Peter 1:19 is also questionable - in the ESV it says "We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until [heos hou] the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts." 

Are we to stop paying attention to the prophetic message once "the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts"? It depends how one interprets that cryptic phrase. It could be referencing the Second Coming of Christ (despite the awkward "in your hearts") and thus prefer the meaning "until a specified time (but not after)", or it could mean something else and thus plausibly mean "until (and continuing)". John Calvin himself noted the difficulty of this passage and examined various possible interpretations.[^jctpon] The passage certainly does not <b>require</b> the meaning "until a specified time (but not after)".

<h4>Matthew 18:34</h4>

Matthew 18:34 is an interesting verse: "And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until [heos hou] he should pay all his debt." On first glance, one would think this passage means that once he pays his debt, he will be released from the jailors. 

Many Protestants interpret this passage differently, however - not wishing to give Catholics additional ammo to defend purgatory. For instance, John Calvin[^jcmetf] and John Wesley[^jwmetf] believe this passage was speaking of judgment and eternal punishment, meaning the "heos hou" here should be interpreted as "until (and continuing)" as the servant would never be released from his jailers (it's an eternal punishment).

Presumably that's a plausible interpretation - meaning the passage does not <b>require</b> the meaning "until a specified time (but not after)" as the argument states.

<h4>Acts 25:21</h4>

In the NASB Acts 25:21 reads "But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor's decision, I ordered that he be kept in custody until [heos hou] I send him to Caesar."

Here, "heos hou" clearly means "until (and continuing)". Paul was to be kept in custody until he is sent to Caesar - and then he would continue to be in custody. 

But not so fast! Proponents of this theory say the NASB mistranslated this, and that the Greek merely says "kept" and not "kept in custody". They then say that the plain meaning in context is clearly that Paul was to be "kept in Caesarea" (not "kept in custody"). Rendered that way, it's obvious that once Paul had been sent to Caesar (in Rome), he would not longer be kept in Caesarea - meaning "heos hou" here clearly means "until a specified time (but not after)".[^erickept]

Whether the NASB (and numerous other) Bible translators are wrong, or the proponents of this theory are wrong, I am not fit to judge. It does seem clear though that the argument's statement that this passage <b>requires</b> the meaning "until a specified time (but not after)" does not hold up - that meaning is clearly not required.

<h3>The Sample Size Problem</h3>

It seems to accept this argument as valid, we must believe that "heos hou" meant one thing shortly before the New Testament era, and the same thing shortly after, but something different in the middle -  based off a reading of a sample size of only 15 usages in the New Testament. 

Moreover, those 15 passages clearly don't <b>require</b> this meaning - indeed, numerous Bible translators and Reformers disagreed with this meaning. So we must believe that the argument holds even if 4 of the 15 examples could plausibly be read in a way that refutes the argument.

However there is a last difficulty we must surmount - this sample size of only 15 usages.

The Septuagint uses "heos hou" around 78 times. Of these, somewhere between 4-11 have the meaning "until (and continuing)".

If we looked for a similar ratio among the 15 usages of "heos hou" in the New Testament, we would expect to find somewhere between 1-2 usages of "heos hou" that have the meaning "until (and continuing)".

Which means... even if all 14 of the other New Testament passages explicitly required the meaning "until a specified time (but not after)", the sample size is so small that it's still entirely plausible that the one additional usage in Matthew 1:25 could be the only one that means "until (and continuing)", consistent with the ratio of usage found in the Septuagint.

<h2>Who Makes The "heos" Argument?</h2>

<h2>GotQuestions.org</h2>
<blockquote>
<h4>[2022] <a href='https://www.gotquestions.org/Jesus-siblings.html'>Did Jesus have brothers and sisters (siblings)?</a></h4>
<i>Some have taught that, due to the sacred nature of the virgin birth, Mary had no other children and remained a virgin throughout her life. However, Matthew 1:24–25 seems to counter that teaching and imply that Mary had other children: "When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus." The key word that tells us that Mary had other children after Jesus is until. Until means "up to the time of." It implies that an action did occur after a prescribed pause. Matthew did not end the sentence by saying, "He did not consummate their marriage." He says, "He did not consummate their marriage until..." This wording indicates that the action (of consummating the marriage) did occur after the birth of Christ. Matthew also makes a point of telling us that Joseph "took Mary home as his wife." Matthew's readers would naturally conclude that Mary became Joseph's wife in every sense of the word. There is no scriptural evidence to support the assertion that Mary remained a perpetual virgin or that she had no other children. In fact, the Bible tells us the opposite.</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4>[2022] <a href='https://www.gotquestions.org/perpetual-virginity-Mary.html'>Is the perpetual virginity of Mary biblical?</a></h4>
<i>So, what does the Bible say about the perpetual virginity of Mary? Using the New American Bible, which is a Catholic translation, we can see that the perpetual virginity of Mary is not taught in the Bible. Matthew 1:25 NAB tells us, "He had no relations with her until she bore a son, and he named him Jesus." He, Joseph, did not have sexual relations with her, Mary, UNTIL after she bore a son, Jesus." The meaning of this Scripture is abundantly clear. Joseph and Mary did not have sexual relations until after Jesus was born.</i>

<i>Another one of the Marian dogmas is... the perpetual virginity of Mary - that she remained a virgin after the birth of Christ, both before, during, and after the birth of Jesus she was always a virgin... [Matthew 1:24-25] Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife and did not know her 'til she had brought forth her firstborn son and called his name Jesus. Now if the Bible taught the perpetual virginity of Mary it would have just said "he never knew her", but their teaching is no they got married but they never consumated the marriage, which is considered a wonderful thing in this scripture. It's a wonderful thing to consumate their marriage, it's a beautiful thing, this is one of the great things of marriage. 1 Corinthians 7 talks about how you're not supposed to stay celibate in marriage, that's not how it works, this is bad for marriage, you want to stay celibate then stay single.</i>

<i>Whatever meaning we finally adopt for [heos hou] in Matt 1:25 must be tempered by the act that this phrase never elsewhere has the meaning "until (and continuing)" in the NT... There are no clear examples of this usage ["until (and continuing)"] for at least a century and a half before Matthew wrote his Gospel, nor up to half a century afterwards... Moreover, when used with the negative, this phrase (at least so far as the NT is concerned) always means "not [main clause] until [subordinate clause], ater which [main clause] ensues." In light of this evidence, the most probable meaning for Matt 1:25 is, "Joseph did not have sexual relations with Mary until she gave birth to a firstborn son, after which sexual relations ensued."</i>

Standard stuff, again goes back to Jerome. But we've been pointing out for a long time now that in Matthew, his use of "heos hou" would not just "heos", but "heos hou", each time did indicate that after the point of the until is reached, that there was a change in the action thereafter.

The ignorance of persons who do not know the sacred scriptures well and have not consulted histories, always turns them to one thing after another, and distracts anyone who wants to track down something about the truth out of his own head. To begin with, when the Virgin was entrusted to Joseph - lots having compelled her to take this step - she was not entrusted to him for marriage, since he was a widower. He was called her husband because of the Law, but it plainly follows from the Jewish tradition that the Virgin was not entrusted to him for matrimony. It was for the preservation of her virginity in witness to the things to come - [a witness] that Christ's incarnation was nothing spurious but was truly attested, as without a man's seed but truly brought about by the Holy Spirit.</i> [From Epiphanius of Salamis' <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=tKtzRNP0Z70C&pg=PA620&lpg=PA620#v=onepage&q&f=false' target='_blank'>The Panarion, De fide.

[^chrommotf]:
    <i>But concerning what the Evangelist said, "And he did not know her till she had borne her firstborn son," not a few careless people insist on asking whether after the Lord’s birth the holy mother Mary had relations with Joseph. But this is not admissible on the grounds of either faith or truth. Far be it indeed that after the sacrament of so great a mystery and after the birth of the sublime Lord, one should believe that the Virgin Mary was intimate with a man. Remember that Miriam the prophetess of the Old Testament (the sister of Moses and Aaron) remained a virgin unsullied by man, having beheld the light of heavenly signs after the plagues of Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea and the Lord’s glory going in advance and seen in a pillar of fire and clouds. It is not plausible therefore that the Mary of the Gospel, a virgin bearing God, who beheld God’s glory not in a cloud but was worthy of carrying him in her virginal womb, had relations with a man. Noah, who was made worthy to converse with God, declared that he would abstain from the conjugal need. Moses, after hearing God calling him from the bush, abstained from conjugal relations. Now are we to believe that Joseph, the man who always did what was right, had relations with holy Mary after the birth of the Lord?</i> [From Chromatius of Aquileia's <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=lYHUtwEACAAJ&q=%22but+concerning%22#v=snippet&q=%22but%20concerning%20what%22&f=false' target='_blank'>Tractate on Matthew 3.1</a>]

[^jcymotf]:
    <i>And when he had taken her, "he knew her not, till she had brought forth her first-born Son." He has here used the word "till," not that you should suspect that afterwards he did know her, but to inform you that before the birth the Virgin was wholly untouched by man. But why then, it may be said, has he used the word, "till"? Because it is usual in Scripture often to do this, and to use this expression without reference to limited times. For so with respect to the ark likewise, it is said, "The raven returned not till the earth was dried up." [Genesis 8:7] And yet it did not return even after that time. And when discoursing also of God, the Scripture says, "From age until age You are," not as fixing limits in this case. And again when it is preaching the Gospel beforehand, and saying, "In his days shall righteousness flourish, and abundance of peace, till the moon be taken away," it does not set a limit to this fair part of creation. So then here likewise, it uses the word "till," to make certain what was before the birth, but as to what follows, it leaves you to make the inference. Thus, what it was necessary for you to learn of Him, this He Himself has said; that the Virgin was untouched by man until the birth; but that which both was seen to be a consequence of the former statement, and was acknowledged, this in its turn he leaves for you to perceive; namely, that not even after this, she having so become a mother, and having been counted worthy of a new sort of travail, and a child-bearing so strange, could that righteous man ever have endured to know her. For if he had known her, and had kept her in the place of a wife, how is it that our Lord [John 19:27] commits her, as unprotected, and having no one, to His disciple, and commands him to take her to his own home? How then, one may say, are James and the others called His brethren? In the same kind of way as Joseph himself was supposed to be husband of Mary. For many were the veils provided, that the birth, being such as it was, might be for a time screened. Wherefore even John so called them, saying, "For neither did His brethren believe in Him."</i> [From John Chrysostom's <a href='https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200105.htm' target='_blank'>Homily 5 on Matthew, Section 5</a>]

His position is made more plain in <a href='http://www.dec25th.info/Augustine%27s%20Sermon%20186.html' target='_blank'>Sermons 186</a> with his statement, "A Virgin conceiving, a Virgin bearing, a Virgin pregnant, a Virgin bringing forth, a Virgin perpetual. Why do you wonder at this, O man?"

    <i>But just as He who was conceived kept her who conceived still virgin, in like manner also He who was born preserved her virginity intact, only passing through her and keeping her closed. [Ezekiel 44:2] The conception, indeed, was through the sense of hearing, but the birth through the usual path by which children come, although some tell tales of His birth through the side of the Mother of God. For it was not impossible for Him to have come by this gate, without injuring her seal in anyway.

    The ever-virgin One thus remains even after the birth still virgin, having never at any time up till death consorted with a man. For although it is written, And knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born Son [Matthew 1:25], yet note that he who is first-begotten is first-born even if he is only-begotten. For the word "first-born" means that he was born first but does not at all suggest the birth of others. And the word "till" signifies the limit of the appointed time but does not exclude the time thereafter. For the Lord says, And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world , not meaning thereby that He will be separated from us after the completion of the age. The divine apostle, indeed, says, And so shall we ever be with the Lord [1 Thessalonians 4:17], meaning after the general resurrection.

    For could it be possible that she, who had borne God and from experience of the subsequent events had come to know the miracle, should receive the embrace of a man. God forbid!</i>

[^toomotf]:
    <i>That is, he never came together with her at all. "Until" here does not mean that before the birth he did not know her and afterwards he did, but that he absolutely never knew her. Scripture employs this expression. For example, the raven "returned not unto the ark until the water had dried off from the earth" (Gen 8:7). But neither did it return after the water had dried off. Again, "I am with you until the end of the world" (Gen 28:20). So after the end He will no longer be with the saints? But how can that be? For at that time more than ever will He be with them. So must you understand here "until she brought forth’’ to mean, neither before the birth nor after the birth did he know her. How could he have touched the Holy Virgin having once understood the ineffable birth giving?

    The evangelist does not call Him "her firstborn son" in the sense that she later gave birth to a second son, but simply that He was the first and only child that she bore. For Christ is both the "firstborn" by having been born first, and the "only begotten," in that He had no brother.

    And here, too, he shows Joseph’s ready obedience to do everything that the angel had told him to do.</i>

[^tamotf]:
    <i>Without any hesitation we must abhor the error of Helvidius, who dared to assert that Christ's Mother, after His Birth, was carnally known by Joseph, and bore other children. For, in the first place, this is derogatory to Christ's perfection: for as He is in His Godhead the Only-Begotten of the Father, being thus His Son in every respect perfect, so it was becoming that He should be the Only-begotten son of His Mother, as being her perfect offspring.

    Secondly, this error is an insult to the Holy Ghost, whose "shrine" was the virginal womb ["Sacrarium Spiritus Sancti" (Office of B. M. V., Ant. ad Benedictus, T. P.), wherein He had formed the flesh of Christ: wherefore it was unbecoming that it should be desecrated by intercourse with man.

    Thirdly, this is derogatory to the dignity and holiness of God's Mother: for thus she would seem to be most ungrateful, were she not content with such a Son; and were she, of her own accord, by carnal intercourse to forfeit that virginity which had been miraculously preserved in her.

    Fourthly, it would be tantamount to an imputation of extreme presumption in Joseph, to assume that he attempted to violate her whom by the angel's revelation he knew to have conceived by the Holy Ghost.

    We must therefore simply assert that the Mother of God, as she was a virgin in conceiving Him and a virgin in giving Him birth, did she remain a virgin ever afterwards.</i>

[^mlmotf]:
    <i>Again, when he says, "And Joseph knew her not until she brought forth her first-born son" [Matt. 1:25], they interpret it as though the evangelist meant to say that he knew her, but not before she had brought forth her first-born son. This was the view of Helvidius which was refuted by Jerome.

    Such carnal interpretations miss the meaning and purpose of the evangelist. As we have said, the evangelist, like the prophet Isaiah, wishes to set before our eyes this mighty wonder, and point out what an unheard-of thing it is for a maiden to be with child before her husband brings her home and lies with her; and further, that he does not know her carnally until she first has a son, which she should have had after first having been known by him. Thus, the words of the evangelist do not refer to anything that occurred after the birth, but only to what took place before it. For the prophet and the evangelist, and St. Paul as well, do not treat of this virgin beyond the point where they have from her that fruit for whose sake she is a virgin and everything else. After the child is born they dismiss the mother and speak not about her, what became of her, but only about her offspring. Therefore, one cannot from these words [Matt. 1:18, 25] conclude that Mary, after the birth of Christ, became a wife in the usual sense; it is therefore neither to be asserted nor believed. All the words are merely indicative of the marvelous fact that she was with child and gave birth before she had lain with a man.

    The form of expression used by Matthew is the common idiom, as if I were to say, "Pharaoh believed not Moses, until he was drowned in the Red Sea." Here it does not follow that Pharaoh believed later, after he had drowned; on the contrary, it means that he never did believe. Similarly when Matthew [1:25] says that Joseph did not know Mary carnally until she had brought forth her son, it does not follow that he knew her subsequently; on the contrary, it means that he never did know her. Again, the Red Sea overwhelmed Pharaoh before he got across. Here too it does not follow that Pharaoh got across later, after the Red Sea had overwhelmed him, but rather that he did not get across at all. In like manner, when Matthew [1:18] says, "She was found to be with child before they came together," it does not follow that Mary subsequently lay with Joseph, but rather that she did not lie with him.

    Elsewhere in Scripture the same manner of speech is employed. Psalm 110 [:1] reads, "God says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool.'" Here it does not follow that Christ does not continue to sit there after his enemies are placed beneath his feet. Again, in Genesis 28 [:15], "I will not leave you until I have done all that of which I have spoken to you." Here God did not leave him after the fulfillment had taken place. Again, in Isaiah 42 [:4], "He shall not be sad, nor troublesome, till he has established justice in the earth." There are many more similar expression, so that this babble of Helvidius is without justification; in addition, he has neither noticed nor paid any attention to either Scripture or the common idiom.</i>

    <i>There have been certain folk who have wished to suggest that from this passage (Matt 1:25) that the Virgin Mary had other children than the Son of God, and that Joseph then dwelt with her later; but what folly this is! For the gospel writer did not wish to record what happened afterwards; he simply wished to make clear Joseph's obedience and to show also that Joseph had been well and truly assured that it was God who had sent His angel to Mary. He had therefore never dwelt with her nor had he shared her company... And besides this Our Lord Jesus Christ is called the first-born. This is not because there was a second or a third, but because the gospel writer is paying regard to the precedence. Scripture speaks thus of naming the first-born whether or not there was any question of the second. Thus we see the intention of the Holy Spirit. This is why to lend ourselves to foolish subtleties would be to abuse Holy Scripture.</i> [From John Calvin's <a href='https://servantofchrist.tripod.com/beholdthymother/id20.html#_Hlk342396738' target='_blank'>Sermon on Matthew 1:22-25, published in 1562</a>]

    <i>And knew her not. This passage afforded the pretext for great disturbances, which were introduced into the Church, at a former period, by Helvidius. The inference he drew from it was, that Mary remained a virgin no longer than till her first birth, and that afterwards she had other children by her husband. Jerome, on the other hand, earnestly and copiously defended Mary's perpetual virginity. Let us rest satisfied with this, that no just and well-grounded inference can be drawn from these words of the Evangelist, as to what took place after the birth of Christ. He is called first-born; but it is for the sole purpose of informing us that he was born of a virgin. It is said that Joseph knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son: but this is limited to that very time. What took place afterwards, the historian does not inform us. Such is well known to have been the practice of inspired writers. Certainly, no man will ever raise a question on this subject, except from curiosity; and no man will obstinately keep up the argument, except from an extreme fondness for disputation.</i> [From John Calvin's <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=c8FNAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA107&ots=oRaQfwI3J9&dq=%22that%20Mary%20remained%20a%20virgin%20no%20longer%20than%20till%20her%20first%20birth%2C%20and%20that%20afterwards%20she%20had%20other%20children%20by%20her%20husband%22&pg=PA107#v=onepage&q=%22that%20Mary%20remained%20a%20virgin%20no%20longer%20than%20till%20her%20first%20birth,%20and%20that%20afterwards%20she%20had%20other%20children%20by%20her%20husband%22&f=false' target='_blank'>Works "Volume 31, Harmony of the Evangelists" #25, page 107</a>]

    <i>Certain expressions in the evangelical narratives are said to imply that Mary bore other children besides the Lord, and it is even asserted that no unprejudiced person could interpret them otherwise. The justice of this charge may be fairly questioned. The context in each case seems to suggest another explanation of these expressions, which does not decide anything one way or the other. St. Matthew writes that Joseph ‘knew not’ his wife ‘till (ewV ou) she brought forth a son’ (1:25); while St. Luke speaks of her bringing forth ‘her firstborn son’ (2:7). St. Matthew’s expression however, ‘till she brought forth,’ as appears from the context, is intended simply to show that Jesus was not begotten in the course of nature; and thus, while it denies any previous intercourse with her husband, it neither asserts nor implies any subsequent intercourse. Again, the prominent idea conveyed by the term ‘firstborn’ to a Jew would be not the birth of other children, but the special consecration of this one. The typical reference in fact is foremost in the mind of St. Luke, as he himself explains it, ‘Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord’ (2:23). Thus ‘firstborn’ does not necessarily suggest ‘later-born,’ any more than ‘son’ suggests ‘daughter.’ The two words together describe the condition under which in obedience to the law a child was consecrated to God. The ‘firstborn son’ is in fact the Evangelist’s equivalent for the ‘male that openeth the womb.’</i> [From J.B.

    <i>In the first place the Greek does not say that Festus held Paul in custody. The Greek word used here is simply “kept” (tēreō), and the verse simply states that Festus “kept” Paul until he could send him to Caesar. The question becomes, Kept where or in what way? The plain meaning in context is that Festus “kept” Paul in Caesarea as opposed to sending him back to Jerusalem (the request of the Jews) to stand trial (vv. 15-20). The point here is not one of “custody,” but location. Obviously, once Paul had been sent to Caesar (Rome) he was no longer “kept” in Caesarea.

How observable is this whole account; as well as the great inference our Lord draws from it: 1. The debtor was freely and fully forgiven; 2. He wilfully and grievously offended; 3. His pardon was retracted, the whole debt required, and the offender delivered to the tormentors for ever.
