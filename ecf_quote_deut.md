<h1>The Argument</h1>

The Catholic Deuterocanonical books (which Protestants identify as Apocrypha) are Tobit, Judith, Baruch, Sirach, Wisdom, 1 and 2 Maccabees, and additions to Daniel and Esther.

The majority of the early Church did not accept these books as scripture, did not quote from these books as scripture, and did not treat these books as scripture.

<i>Beyond Palestine, however, Jews were more inclined to consider as Scripture writings not included in this list of books. The Greek translation of the Old Testament called the Septuagint was especially influential in making known certain books of the Apocrypha because it included these books along with the Old Testament books accepted in Palestine. Early Christians also differed, then, over the question of the Apocrypha. Believers in the eastern portion of the Roman Empire, nearest Palestine, tended to agree with the Jews in that area. In the West, however, Christians under the influence of Augustine, the well-known bishop of Hippo, usually received the Apocrypha as part of the canon of Scripture. During the sixteenth-century Reformation most Protestants accepted the view of early eastern Christians and rejected the Apocrypha as canonical. The Roman Catholic church, following Augustine, accepted the books. And that is how the churches differ to this day.</i>

<i>In the early years of the church it drew up various lists of the books it considered to be Old Testament Scripture. The books of the Apocrypha do not appear on any list until late in the fourth century. This demonstrates the acceptance of these writings was not immediate... While a few of the early leaders of the church accepted some of the books of Apocrypha as Scripture, most of the great church leaders did not-Athanasius, Origen, and Jerome, to name a few. Many great church leaders spoke out against the Apocrypha. Those who do cite the Apocrypha as Scripture were few in number. It is also worth noting that none of the church fathers that quoted the Apocrypha as Scripture knew any Hebrew.</i>

<i>There is no such thing as scripture that is no longer canon... If it was ever scripture, it is still scripture, and Christians - we don't decide what's part of the Bible or not, the Canon is simply a fact of reality. It just is what it is. God inspired these books, they are canon, whether you include them or acknowledge them or not they are canon, then we have our list, which is our opinions about what actually is canon. I believe that the list that the Protestants have is the correct list, and is the list that Jesus would approve. I believe it's the list that represents actual canon. But when I say that 1st and 2nd Maccabees don't belong in the Bible, I'm not saying they are no longer canon, and I don't think they are scripture, because that's a term I would use to describe what is part of canon - I think they never were at any point part of it, and that they were included in some people's lists mistakenly.</i>

    <i>Having then this hope, let our souls be bound to Him who is faithful in His promises, and just in His judgments. He who has commanded us not to lie, shall much more Himself not lie; for nothing is impossible with God, except to lie. Let His faith therefore be stirred up again within us, and let us consider that all things are near unto Him. By the word of His might He established all things, and by His word He can overthrow them. "Who shall say unto Him, What have you done? [Wisdom 12:12] Or, Who shall resist the power of His strength?" [Wisdom 11:21]  When, and as He pleases, He will do all things, and none of the things determined by Him shall pass away. [Matthew 24:35] All things are open before Him, and nothing can be hidden from His counsel. "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament shows His handy-work. Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night shows knowledge. And there are no words or speeches of which the voices are not heard."

    <i>Many women also, being strengthened by the grace of God, have performed numerous manly exploits. The blessed Judith, when her city was besieged, asked of the elders permission to go forth into the camp of the strangers; and, exposing herself to danger, she went out for the love which she bare to her country and people then besieged; and the Lord delivered Holofernes into the hands of a woman. [Judith 8:30] Esther also, being perfect in faith, exposed herself to no less danger, in order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from impending destruction. For with fasting and humiliation she entreated the everlasting God, who sees all things; and He, perceiving the humility of her spirit, delivered the people for whose sake she had encountered peril.</i> [From Clement of Rome's <a href='https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1010.htm' target='_blank'>Letter to the Corinthians 55</a>]

You shall not hesitate to give, nor murmur when you give; for you shall know who is the good repayer of the hire. You shall not turn away from him that is in want, but you shall share all things with your brother, and shall not say that they are your own; for if you are partakers in that which is immortal, how much more in things which are mortal? You shall not remove your hand from your son or from your daughter, but from their youth shall teach them the fear of God.

When you can do good, defer it not, because "alms delivers from death." [Tobit 4:10, Tobit 12:9] Be all of you subject one to another [1 Peter 5:5] "having your conduct blameless among the Gentiles", [1 Peter 2:12] that you may both receive praise for your good works, and the Lord may not be blasphemed through you.

    <i>Those, however, who are believed to be presbyters by many, but serve their own lusts, and, do not place the fear of God supreme in their hearts, but conduct themselves with contempt towards others, and are puffed up with the pride of holding the chief seat, [Matt. 23:6] and work evil deeds in secret, saying, "No man sees us," shall be convicted by the Word, who does not judge after outward appearance (secundum gloriam), nor looks upon the countenance, but the heart; and they shall hear those words, to be found in Daniel the prophet: "O you seed of Canaan, and not of Judah, beauty has deceived you, and lust perverted your heart." [Dan. 13:56] You that are waxen old in wicked days, now your sins which you have committed aforetime have come to light; for you have pronounced false judgments, and have been accustomed to condemn the innocent, and to let the guilty go free, albeit the Lord says, "The innocent and the righteous shall you not slay."

[^iren2]: 
    <i>If, however, any shall endeavour to allegorize [prophecies] of this kind, they shall not be found consistent with themselves in all points, and shall be confuted by the teaching of the very expressions [in question]. For example: "When the cities" of the Gentiles "shall be desolate, so that they be not inhabited, and the houses so that there shall be no men in them and the land shall be left desolate." [Isaiah 6:11] "For, behold," says Isaiah, "the day of the Lord comes past remedy, full of fury and wrath, to lay waste the city of the earth, and to root sinners out of it." [Isaiah 13:9] And again he says, "Let him be taken away, that he behold not the glory of God." [Isaiah 26:10] And when these things are done, he says, "God will remove men far away, and those that are left shall multiply in the earth." [Isaiah 6:12] "And they shall build houses, and shall inhabit them themselves: and plant vineyards, and eat of them themselves." [Isaiah 65:21] For all these and other words were unquestionably spoken in reference to the resurrection of the just, which takes place after the coming of Antichrist, and the destruction of all nations under his rule; in [the times of] which [resurrection] the righteous shall reign in the earth, waxing stronger by the sight of the Lord: and through Him they shall become accustomed to partake in the glory of God the Father, and shall enjoy in the kingdom intercourse and communion with the holy angels, and union with spiritual beings; and [with respect to] those whom the Lord shall find in the flesh, awaiting Him from heaven, and who have suffered tribulation, as well as escaped the hands of the Wicked one. For it is in reference to them that the prophet says: "And those that are left shall multiply upon the earth," <ins>And Jeremiah the prophet has pointed out</ins>, that as many believers as God has prepared for this purpose, to multiply those left upon earth, should both be under the rule of the saints to minister to this Jerusalem, and that [His] kingdom shall be in it, <ins>saying</ins>, "Look around Jerusalem towards the east, and behold the joy which comes to you from God Himself. Behold, your sons shall come whom you have sent forth: they shall come in a band from the east even unto the west, by the word of that Holy One, rejoicing in that splendour which is from your God. O Jerusalem, put off your robe of mourning and of affliction, and put on that beauty of eternal splendour from your God. Gird yourself with the double garment of that righteousness proceeding from your God; place the mitre of eternal glory upon your head. For God will show your glory to the whole earth under heaven. For your name shall for ever be called by God Himself, the peace of righteousness and glory to him that worships God. Arise, Jerusalem, stand on high, and look towards the east, and behold your sons from the rising of the sun, even to the west, by the Word of that Holy One, rejoicing in the very remembrance of God. For the footmen have gone forth from you, while they were drawn away by the enemy. God shall bring them in to you, being borne with glory as the throne of a kingdom. For God has decreed that every high mountain shall be brought low, and the eternal hills, and that the valleys be filled, so that the surface of the earth be rendered smooth, that Israel, the glory of God, may walk in safety. The woods, too, shall make shady places, and every sweet-smelling tree shall be for Israel itself by the command of God. For God shall go before with joy in the light of His splendour, with the pity and righteousness which proceeds from Him."

    <i>If we satisfied ourselves with advancing such considerations as these, our doctrines might by some be looked upon as human. But, since the voices of the prophets confirm our arguments — for I think that you also, with your great zeal for knowledge, and your great attainments in learning, cannot be ignorant of the writings either of Moses or of Isaiah and Jeremiah, and the other prophets, who, lifted in ecstasy above the natural operations of their minds by the impulses of the Divine Spirit, uttered the things with which they were inspired, the Spirit making use of them as a flute-player breathes into a flute — what, then, do these men say? "The Lord is our God; no other can be compared with Him." [Baruch 3:35] And again: "I am God, the first and the last, and besides Me there is no God." [Isaiah 44:6] In like manner: "Before Me there was no other God, and after Me there shall be none; I am God, and there is none besides Me." [Isaiah 43:10-11] And as to His greatness: "Heaven is My throne, and the earth is the footstool of My feet: what house will you build for Me, or what is the place of My rest?" [Isaiah 66:1] But I leave it to you, when you meet with the books themselves, to examine carefully the prophecies contained in them, that you may on fitting grounds defend us from the abuse cast upon us.</i> [From Athenagoras' <a href='https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0205.htm' target='_blank'>A Plea for the Christians, Chapter 9</a>]

[^cloa3]:
    <i>The Elegies of Solon, too, intensely deify the seventh day. And how? Is it not similar to Scripture when it says, "Let us remove the righteous man from us, because he is troublesome to us?" [Wisdom 2:12] when Plato, all but predicting the economy of salvation, says in the second book of the Republic as follows: "Thus he who is constituted just shall be scourged, shall be stretched on the rack, shall be bound, have his eyes put out; and at last, having suffered all evils, shall be crucified."</i> [From Clement of Alexandria's <a href='https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02105.htm' target='_blank'>The Stromata (Book V), Chapter 14</a>]

There is no finding of their works. They have vanished, and gone down to Hades."

    <i>And how can the law be not good, which trains, which is given as the instructor (παιδαγωγός) to Christ, [Galatians 3:24] that being corrected by fear, in the way of discipline, in order to the attainment of the perfection which is by Christ? "I will not," it is said, "the death of the sinner, as his repentance." Now the commandment works repentance; inasmuch as it deters from what ought not to be done, and enjoins good deeds. By ignorance he means, in my opinion, death. "And he that is near the Lord is full of stripes." [Judith 8:27] Plainly, he, that draws near to knowledge, has the benefit of perils, fears, troubles, afflictions, by reason of his desire for the truth. "For the son who is instructed turns out wise, and an intelligent son is saved from burning. And an intelligent son will receive the commandments." And Barnabas the apostle having said, "Woe to those who are wise in their own conceits, clever in their own eyes," [Isaiah 5:21] added, "Let us become spiritual, a perfect temple to God; let us, as far as in us lies, practice the fear of God, and strive to keep His commands, that we may rejoice in His judgments." Whence "the fear of God" is divinely said to be the beginning of wisdom.

[^hip1]: 
    <i>I produce now the prophecy of Solomon, which speaks of Christ, and announces clearly and perspicuously things concerning the Jews; and those which not only are befalling them at the present time, but those, too, which shall befall them in the future age, on account of the contumacy and audacity which they exhibited toward the Prince of Life; for the prophet says, "The ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright," that is, about Christ, "Let us lie in wait for the righteous, because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings and words, and upbraids us with our offending the law, and professes to have knowledge of God; and he calls himself the Child of God." [Wisd. 2:1,12,13] And then he says, "He is grievous to us even to behold; for his life is not like other men's, and his ways are of another fashion. We are esteemed of him as counterfeits, and he abstains from our ways as from filthiness, and pronounces the end of the just to be blessed." [Wisd. 2:15,16] And again, listen to this, O Jew! None of the righteous or prophets called himself the Son of God. And therefore, as in the person of the Jews, Solomon speaks again of this righteous one, who is Christ, thus: "He was made to reprove our thoughts, and he makes his boast that God is his Father. Let us see, then, if his words be true, and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him; for if the just man be the Son of God, He will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies. Let us condemn him with a shameful death, for by his own saying he shall be respected."

    <i>Thus it is written: "This is our God, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of Him.

[^orig1]: 
    <i>But these pray along with those who genuinely pray - not only the high priest but also the angels who "rejoice in heaven over one repenting sinner more than over ninety-nine righteous that need not repentance," and also the souls of the saints already at rest. Two instances make this plain. The first is where Raphael offers their service to God for Tobit and Sarah. After both had prayed, the scripture says, "The prayer of both was heard before the presence of the great Raphael and he was sent to heal them both," [Tobit 3:16-17] and Raphael himself, when explaining his angelic commission at God's command to help them, says: "Even now when you prayed, and Sarah your daughter-in-law, I brought the memorial of your prayer before the Holy One," and shortly after, "I am Raphael, one of the Seven angels who present the prayers of saints and enter in before the glory of the Holy One." [Tobit 12:6-15] Thus, according to Raphael's account at least, prayer with fasting and almsgiving and righteousness is a good thing.</i> [From Origen's <a href='http://www.ccel.org/ccel/origen/prayer.vii.html' target='_blank'>On Prayer, Chapter 6</a>]

[^orig3]: 
    <i>When someone becomes a worshipper in the land, God has arranged that someone rejected from their own and came to the land about which it is written: Hear Israel.  "Why is it that you are in the land of enemies, that you are counted among those in Hades?  You have forsaken the fountain of life, the Lord.

    <i>Wherefore the brotherhood of the three also, when the dedication of the royal image was the occasion of the citizens being pressed to offer worship, knew well what faith, which alone in them had not been taken captive, required — namely, that they must resist idolatry to the death. [Daniel 3:12] For they remembered also the words of Jeremias writing to those over whom that captivity was impending: "And now you shall see borne upon (men's) shoulders the gods of the Babylonians, of gold and silver and wood, causing fear to the Gentiles. Beware, therefore, that you also do not be altogether like the foreigners, and be seized with fear while you behold crowds worshipping those gods before and behind, but say in your mind, Our duty is to worship You, O Lord." [Baruch 6:3] Therefore, having got confidence from God, they said, when with strength of mind they set at defiance the king's threats against the disobedient: "There is no necessity for our making answer to this command of yours. For our God whom we worship is able to deliver us from the furnace of fire and from your hands; and then it will be made plain to you that we shall neither serve your idol, nor worship your golden image which you have set up."

[^tert2]:
    <i>...and better than all others, there are our Christian authorities. We are taught by God concerning both these questions — viz. that there is a ruling power in the soul, and that it is enshrined in one particular recess of the body. For, when one reads of God as being "the searcher and witness of the heart;" [Wisdom 1:6] when His prophet is reproved by His discovering to him the secrets of the heart; [Proverbs 24:12] when God Himself anticipates in His people the thoughts of their heart, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?" [Matthew 9:4] when David prays "Create in me a clean heart, O God," and Paul declares, "With the heart man believes unto righteousness," [Romans 10:10] and John says, "By his own heart is each man condemned;" [1 John 3:20]</i> [From Tertullian's <a href='https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0310.htm' target='_blank'>A Treatise on the Soul, Chapter 15</a>]

Let virgins alone be veiled, and this when they are coming to be married, and not till they have recognised their destined husband. If Susanna also, who was subjected to unveiling on her trial, furnishes an argument for the veiling of women, I can say here also, the veil was a voluntary thing. She had come accused, ashamed of the disgrace she had brought on herself, properly concealing her beauty, even because now she feared to please.</i> [From Tertullian's <a href='https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0304.htm' target='_blank'>The Chaplet, or De Corona - Chapter 4</a>]

As gold in the furnace has He tried them, and received them as a sacrifice of a burnt-offering, and in due time regard shall be had unto them.

[1 Corinthians 2:9] As also God said to Abraham, that "he could not number the stars; " [Genesis 15:5] and that passage, "Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain" [Sirach 1:2] How shall any one be able to investigate too curiously the subsistence of the divine Word, unless he be smitten with frenzy? Concerning which the Spirit of prophecy says, "Who shall declare his generation? " [Isaiah 53:8] And our Saviour Himself, who blesses the pillars of all things in the world, sought to unburden them of the knowledge of these things, saying that to comprehend this was quite beyond their nature, and that to the Father alone belonged the knowledge of this most divine mystery. "For no man," says He, "knows the Son, but the Father: neither knows any man the Father, save the Son."

Now if the appearing of Gabriel wrought trembling in the Prophets, had God Himself been seen as He is, would not all have perished?

For if you think that he who is sent is inferior to him by whom he is sent, you must learn also that an inferior has sent a superior, and that superiors have been sent to inferiors.

What then is this testimony? God, rebuking the Jews, speaks thus through the prophet: "The earth has brought forth her fruit, and ye have not brought in the tithes; but the plunder of the poor is in |51 your houses," (Mal. 3:10) Since, it is said, ye have not given the customary oblations, ye have robbed the poor. This is said in order to show to the rich that they possess things which belong to the poor, even if their property be gained by inheritance, - in fact, from what source soever their substance be derived.
