<h2>Matthew 18:1-4</h2>
<blockquote>
<i>
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them and said, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. “Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin,[a] it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.

<h2>Mark 9:33-37</h2>
<blockquote>
<i>
And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?” But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest. And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, “If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.” And he took a child and put him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them, “Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.”

<h2>Luke 9:46-48</h2>
<blockquote>
<i>
An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest. But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side and said to them, “Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.”

<h1>The Legend</h1>

<h2>Ignatius of Antioch, child that Jesus took in His arms</h2>

The most winsome of these legends is bound up with the two names he bore and which he wrote in Greek at the head of his letters: “Ignatios o kai Theophoros”. In the Roman Empire men frequently identified themselves by two names, one for legal purposes and the other personal, united by the Latin formula qui et or in Greek o kai (who is):  Ignatios, (ignis: fire) his family name, and Theophoros presumably adopted at baptism. Theophoros in Greek has two meanings: in the active mode it means “he who bears God”; in the passive mode it refers to “he who is carried by God”.

The passive meaning gave birth to the legend that Ignatius as a child had personally met the Lord Jesus and indeed that he was the child whom Jesus held in his arms and presented as a model to the apostles of man’s right relationship with God (see Matthew 18:2 and Luke 9:47). This was the opinion of the ancient writer, Anastasius the Librarian (c. 810 – c. 878) although neither Ignatius’s contemporary, St. Polycarp, nor Saint Irenaeus, nor any ancient Christian writer refer to this incident.

<h1>The Historical Record</h1>


In 1672 he published at Cambridge Vindiciae epistolarum S. Ignatii, in 4to, in answer to Jean Daillé. His defence of the authenticity of the letters of Ignatius has been confirmed by J. B. Lightfoot and other scholars.

^This was who he was arguing with, apparently JB Lightfoot confirmed his work as well.

Dallaeus presents the status of this question and triumphs in its solution: "It is asked," he says, "whether and for what reason Ignatius was called Theophorus." Indeed, no one has yet asked whether our Ignatius was called Theophorus; the ancients and the moderns have given different reasons for the name; therefore, it can be questioned who has explained the true reason for the name: "The Greeks, who confer this name, pronounce Theophoron with the stress on the second syllable, and thus testify that it was so called because Christ had once carried him in his arms as a small child." 

"Quaeritur, inquit an et qua de causa Ignatius vocatus sit Theophorus"

"Qui hoc cum nomine, inquiunt, donant Graeci, [Theophorus] cum tono in secunda syllaba efferunt, atque ita a se suisque ideo dictum testantur, quod Christus eum adhuc parvulum manu in ulnas susceptam tulisset."

The tale of St. Ignatius as a child in the arms of Christ, receiving this title, is a much later story. Another tradition, contemporary to this fable, was unknown to the ancients. Anastasius and Metaphrastes were the first to recall this fable. The fable seems to have originated during the era of Ignatius, Patriarch of Constantinople.
<hr>
[<a href='https://archive.org/details/patrologiaecurs92migngoog/page/n206/mode/2up'>Page 404</a>] 
Yet still, there appears no tale or trace of this fable, or another meaning of Theophoros, either fully or in fragments.

Among the oldest, whom Dalleus cites for his story, are Anastasius the Librarian, and Simeon Metaphrastes; of whom the latter did not write the Lives of the Saints until after the beginning of the tenth century; the former, however, toward the end of the ninth century, translated the eighth synod into Latin. In his notes, he sprinkles this comment: "The Greeks relate that the little child whom the Lord set in the midst as advocate, saying: Unless you turn and become like this child, etc., was Ignatius, and therefore they call him God-bearer. Hence, even the apostles dared not lay hands on him any more when he was promoted to the presidency of the Church; indeed, whom they recognized as praised by the mouth of God and sanctified by his touch." But who, pray tell, were these Greeks who handed down such fables about St. Ignatius? Certainly not the ancients, none of those who wrote in the Greek Church before Anastasius. 

St. Chrysostom, presbyter of the Church of Antioch, clearly refutes both tales, stating that Ignatius never saw Christ, and that the apostles raised him to the order of bishop by the laying on of hands. "I admire the man, because he obtained this leadership from those saints, and the hands of the blessed apostles touched that holy head." After St. Chrysostom, Theodoretus, bishop in Syria, who held many sermons in Antioch, in dialogue 1: You have indeed heard of that Ignatius, who received the grace of the high priesthood through the right hand of the great Peter. After Theodoret, Felix, the bishop of Rome, wrote to Zeno about Peter of Antioch: "Who most unworthily thrust himself into the Holy Church of Antioch, and polluted the holy seat of the pontificate of Ignatius the martyr, who was ordained bishop by Peter's right hand." Neither to the Greeks nor to the Latins was the ordination of Ignatius known without the laying on of hands either in the fourth or fifth century. I therefore do not doubt that those Greeks who handed down these traditions, having preached the Gospel, came to the voluntary and vital cross, as Ignatius the God-bearer and martyr teaches, was present, while he participated in a secret synod. The dispute at that time concerned Ignatius of Constantinople, the patriarch particularly detested by the Romans, and Photius. This Ignatius’ name was great, both because of the dignity of the position he had lost, and because of the exiles and hardships he had endured, hence he was newly called Theophoros. Michael Syncellus in his Encomium states: "This new and great Theophoros, Ignatius." The chronology ascribed to Nicephorus in the London manuscript states: "Ignatius the new Theophoros was first exiled for eleven years and five months." The bishop of Rome was particularly focused on restoring him; Anastasius, sent to Constantinople, sweated greatly in this effort, and having interacted with the Ignatians, who tried to overthrow Photius, heard these tales from them, completely unknown to the ancient Greeks and utterly contrary to the notion of Theophoros celebrated by the ancients. Simeon Metaphrastes received the same tale from them and transmitted it among many to posterity. If this story is true, as it seems to me: for so many centuries, the later use of the name Theophoros was such that the name did not arise from that tale, but rather, misunderstood by the Greeks, a fabricated tale was concocted by those devoted to embellishing and supporting their patriarch, and is considered to have merit. Therefore, the consideration of time is in no way violated by this name.

Dallaeus presents the status of this question and triumphs in its solution: "It is asked," he says, "whether and for what reason Ignatius was called Theophorus." Indeed, no one has yet asked whether our Ignatius was called Theophorus; the ancients and the moderns have given different reasons for the name; therefore, it can be questioned who has explained the true reason for the name: "The Greeks, who confer this name, pronounce Theophoron with the stress on the second syllable, and thus testify that it was so called because Christ had once carried him in his arms as a small child." But are all these Greeks, who bestow this name on him? Does not the author of the letters always call him Theophoros with the accent on the penultimate syllable? Does not Maximus also often mention that Ignatius himself used and wrote this term with the same accent?

Do not Ephrem, Gobar, and Job, as represented by Photius, speak in this manner? Do not the most ancient Acts introduce Ignatius himself explaining the meaning of his name in this way? Have not the most ancient Greek writers frequently observed that the term Theophoros was attributed to holy men in this sense? I believe no one ever wrote Theophoros with the stress on the second syllable before the tenth century, that is, before the tale was born. Anastasius himself translates Ignatius Theophoros as "Ignatius the God-bearer"; and Ignatius of Constantinople was nicknamed neos Theophoros. It was Primus Metaphrastes who shifted the accent to make the fable appear more dramatic on stage, and others followed him.

This was easy for them, since common words turned into proper names often change accent. Theophoros was an epithet that particularly stuck to the name of Ignatius, not because it was his proper name or became so, but because the people consistently attributed this epithet to him, as St. Athanasius reports about Anthony: "All his neighbors, who were lovers of beauty and virtue and accustomed to his ways, thus seeing him, called him 'the beloved of God'." Those Greeks later, as if it were a proper name, wrote Theophoros, since proper names tend to attract accents.

<i>
I must say a word on the third title given to this day, namely, the Feast of St. Simeon the Just. It is thus called because on this day that glorious saint received into his arms Him whom he had so longed for, but with joy and consolation so great that, having now nothing more to hope for and seeing his end near, he sang like a divine swan that beautiful canticle: Now, Master, You can dismiss Your servant in peace, for my eyes have witnessed Your saving deed.

To explain this third title I shall give you a very profitable example; and although I have alluded to it before in this place, I do not hesitate to offer it to you again inasmuch as many who are before me now were not present then. Besides, we do not, when speaking of the same subject, always say the same thing. The fact is this: Our Lord, seeing a little child one day, picked him up, kissed him and showed him to the Apostles, saying: I tell you solemnly, unless you become like this little child you will never enter Paradise. [Mt, 18:2-3; Mk. 9:35]. Many say that this child was St. Martial, who later became Bishop of Limoges; but the more common opinion is that it was St. Ignatius the martyr, whose feast we celebrated yesterday and whose Office is transferred to tomorrow. Oh, how blessed was this glorious St. Ignatius, since he was taken up into Our Lord's arms and given as an example to the Apostles! How precious and sweet was that kiss! What sacred, secret words Our Lord said to this happy child as He kissed him! How blessed he was to allow himself to be carried and handled by the Saviour, who rewarded him by engraving His own sacred Name in the depths of his heart!

Now tell me, please, whom do you consider to have been the happier: St. Ignatius, who was carried in Our Lord's arms, or St. Simeon the Just, who carried Our Lord in his arms? Tell me, which would you prefer: to be carried by this dear Saviour as was St. Ignatius, or to carry Him in your arms as did Simeon? Surely both were very happy —  St. Ignatius in being handled and carried not where he willed but where it pleased Our Lord, and St. Simeon in carrying in his arms Him who produced such great happiness that he shed upon this Divine Saviour abundant tears of sweetness and consolation. But if you had to choose, which would you prefer? Think about it, for it will be a very useful reflection; and afterwards I will tell you my choice.

The Greeks relate that the small child whom the Lord placed in their midst, saying, "Unless you turn and become like this child" (Matthew 18:3), etc., was this Ignatius, and therefore they call him God-bearer: indeed, not even the apostles dared to lay their hands on him again when he was promoted to the bishopric of the Church, clearly recognizing him as one praised by the mouth of God and sanctified by His touch.
