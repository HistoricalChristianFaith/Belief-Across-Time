<h1>The Argument</h1>

Athanasius supports the Protestant canon, rejecting the Deuterocanonical books.

<h1>Difficulties With This Argument</h1>

Modern Christians tend to lump books into one of two buckets - Canon or Apocrypha. This was not the case for some notable earlier Christians, like Athanasius.

Athanasius indicated three categories of books[^ath39]: 
<ul>
    <li>Canon <i>(in which he includes Baruch and excludes Esther)</i></li>
    <li>books to be read by new Christians who wish for instruction in the word of godliness <i>(Esther, Deuterocanonical books, Sherpherd of Hermas, Teaching of the Apostles)</i></li>
    <li>Apocryphal writings <i>(inventions of heretics to lead astray the simple)</i> </li>
</ul>

Protestants emphasize the fact that Athanasius made a distinction between most of the Deuterocanonical books and the Canon, indicating he did not consider those books as Canon. 

However we must not overlook the fact that Athanasius clearly did not consider them to be Apocrypha, as Protestants do. Indeed, Athanasius found them important for new Christians to read, as these works give instruction in the word of godliness - is that a description of how Protestants consider these works?

Would Athanasius consider them to be closer to Canon, or Apocryphal writings? Did he consider them to be scripture? Inspired? Able to confirm doctrine? 

Across his various writings, Athanasius:

- references Wisdom 7:25-26 as Scripture[^athq1]
- references Wisdom 14:21 as Scripture[^athq2]
- quotes Wisdom 14:12 as "the wisdom of God"[^athq3]
- quotes from Wisdom 13:5 as Scripture[^athq4]
- quotes from Wisdom 9:2 as divine Scripture[^athq5]
- quotes from Tobit 4:18 as "it is written"[^athq6]
- quotes from Tobit 12:7 as "it is written"[^athq7]
- quotes from Judith 8:16 as Scripture[^athq8]
- quotes from Sirach 15:9 as "words spoken by the Spirit"[^athq9]

Note that those examples across his writings are not addressed to new Christians, but rather Athanasius is using these quotations of Deuterocanonical books as "scripture" to defend the orthodox faith in controversies.

In the modern day, Canon = inspiration. That's why we have only two categories, canonical books (inspired) or apocryphal books (not inspired). 

Athanasius is clearly not using the word Canon in the same way - he identifies these Deuterocanonical books as "words spoken by the spirit" and scripture, even if he doesn't put in them in "Canon" category.

One thing is certain though - Athanasius does not believe these books to be Apocrypha as Protestants do.

<i>In the East, for example, well after the 4th century, you've got... a canon of scripture that is a dominant view that is very similar to the Protestant canon. This comes from the Synod of Laodecia, and you see it all throughout the major Eastern theologians, Cyril of Jerusalem, Athanasius, Gregory of Nazianzus, all the way to John of Damascus in the 7th century there's this idea of a 22 book Hebrew canon based upon the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. It's a little tricky, there's little exceptions, the book of Baruch and also the book of the Letter of Jeremiah is often included as a part of Jeremiah all as one book, and then Susannah is included as part of Daniel sometimes, also now and again you'll get Esther as being excluded, but the vast majority of the Deuterocanonical books are excluded in this Eastern tradition, that's the common canon in the East.</i>

    <i>And Dionysius accordingly acted as he learned from the Apostles. For as the heresy of Sabellius was creeping on, he was compelled, as I said before, to write the aforesaid letter, and to hurl at them what is said of the Saviour in reference to His manhood and His humiliation, so as to bar them by reason of His human attributes from saying that the Father was a son, and so render easier for them the teaching concerning the Godhead of the Son, when in his other letters he calls Him from the Scriptures the word, wisdom, power, breath, and brightness of the Father.

[^ath39]:
    <i>In proceeding to make mention of these things, I shall adopt, to commend my undertaking, the pattern of Luke the Evangelist, saying on my own account: 'Forasmuch as some have taken in hand Luke 1:1,' to reduce into order for themselves the books termed apocryphal, and to mix them up with the divinely inspired Scripture, concerning which we have been fully persuaded, as they who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word, delivered to the fathers; it seemed good to me also, having been urged thereto by true brethren, and having learned from the beginning, to set before you the books included in the Canon, and handed down, and accredited as Divine; to the end that any one who has fallen into error may condemn those who have led him astray; and that he who has continued steadfast in purity may again rejoice, having these things brought to his remembrance.

    There are, then, of the <u>Old Testament</u>, twenty-two books in number; for, as I have heard, it is handed down that this is the number of the letters among the Hebrews; their respective order and names being as follows. The first is Genesis, then Exodus, next Leviticus, after that Numbers, and then Deuteronomy. Following these there is Joshua, the son of Nun, then Judges, then Ruth. And again, after these four books of Kings, the first and second being reckoned as one book, and so likewise the third and fourth as one book. And again, the first and second of the Chronicles are reckoned as one book. Again Ezra, the first and second are similarly one book. After these there is the book of Psalms, then the Proverbs, next Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs. Job follows, then the Prophets, the twelve being reckoned as one book. Then Isaiah, one book, then Jeremiah <u>with Baruch</u>, Lamentations, and the epistle, one book; afterwards, Ezekiel and Daniel, each one book. Thus far constitutes the Old Testament.

    Again it is not tedious to speak of the [books] of the New Testament. These are, the four Gospels, according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Afterwards, the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles (called Catholic), seven, viz. of James, one; of Peter, two; of John, three; after these, one of Jude. In addition, there are fourteen Epistles of Paul, written in this order. The first, to the Romans; then two to the Corinthians; after these, to the Galatians; next, to the Ephesians; then to the Philippians; then to the Colossians; after these, two to the Thessalonians, and that to the Hebrews; and again, two to Timothy; one to Titus; and lastly, that to Philemon. And besides, the Revelation of John. 

    These are fountains of salvation, that they who thirst may be satisfied with the living words they contain. In these alone is proclaimed the doctrine of godliness. Let no man add to these, neither let him take ought from these. For concerning these the Lord put to shame the Sadducees, and said, 'You err, not knowing the Scriptures.' And He reproved the Jews, saying, 'Search the Scriptures, for these are they that testify of Me Matthew 22:29; John 5:39.'

    But for greater exactness I add this also, writing of necessity; that there are <u>other books besides these not indeed included in the Canon, but appointed by the Fathers to be read by those who newly join us, and who wish for instruction in the word of godliness. The Wisdom of Solomon, and the Wisdom of Sirach, and Esther, and Judith, and Tobit</u>, and that which is called the Teaching of the Apostles, and the Shepherd. <u>But the former, my brethren, are included in the Canon, the latter being read; nor is there in any place a mention of apocryphal writings. But they are an invention of heretics, who write them when they choose, bestowing upon them their approbation, and assigning to them a date, that so, using them as ancient writings, they may find occasion to lead astray the simple.</u></i>
