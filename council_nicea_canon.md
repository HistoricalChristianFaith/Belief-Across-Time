<h1>Tracing the Legend through History</h1>

<h2>[AD 2003] Dan Brown's fictional <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code' target='_blank'>Da Vinci Code</a></h2>

In 2003, Dan Brown released a book that became a bestseller (temporarily, of course - in 50 years it will be dead to history). In speaking/writing about his book, he continuously insisted that while the novel itself is a work of fiction, all the historical information in it is accurate and well-researched.

In this book, Dan Brown writes:
<blockquote>
The Bible is a product of man, my dear. Not of God. The Bible did not magically fall from the clouds. The Bible, as we know it today, was collated by the pagan Roman emperor Constantine the Great. In 325 AD, he decided to unify Rome under a single religion: Christianity. Constantine needed to strengthen the new Christian tradition and held a famous gathering known as the Council of Nicea... Constantine commissioned and financed a new Bible, which omitted those gospels that spoke of Christ's human traits and embellished those gospels that made him godlike. The earlier gospels were outlawed, gathered up and burned.
</blockquote>

<h2>[AD 1829] <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(Radical)' target='_blank'>Robert Taylor's</a> The Diegesis</h2>

The full title of Robert Taylor's book is "The Diegesis: Being a Discovery of the Origin, Evidences, and Early History of Christianity, Never Yet Before or Elsewhere So Fully and Faithfully Set Forth". 

In this book, Robert Taylor writes (<a href='https://archive.org/details/diegesisbeingdis01tayl/page/432/mode/2up?view=theater' target='_blank'>page 432</a>):
<blockquote>
A.D. 327. Grand Council of Nice in Bythinia, under the presidency of Constantine the Great, gave us the God of God creed used in the communion service. Pappus, in his Synodicon to the council of Nice, asserts, that having promiscuously put all the books under the communion table in a church, they besought the Lord, that the inspired records might get upon the table, while the spurious ones remained underneath, which accordingly happened.
</blockquote>

Note the source for his claim - "Pappus, in his Synodicon to the council of Nice".

<h2>[AD 1794] <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine' target='_blank'>Thomas Paine's</a> Age of Reason</h2>

Thomas Paine does not mention the Council of Nicea by name, but his statement meshes well with the underlying argument we are tracing here that the Council of Nicea voted on the canon of scripture.

In this book, Thomas Paine writes (<a href='http://www.ushistory.org/paine/reason/reason4.htm' target='_blank'>Part First, Section 4</a>):
<blockquote>
When the Church Mythologists established their system, they collected all the writings they could find, and managed them as they pleased. It is a matter altogether of uncertainty to us whether such of the writings as now appear under the name of the Old and New Testament are in the same state in which those collectors say they found them, or whether they added, altered, abridged, or dressed them up.

Be this as it may, they decided by vote which of the books out of the collection they had made should be the WORD OF GOD, and which should not. They rejected several; they voted others to be doubtful, such as the books called the Apocrypha; and those books which had a majority of votes, were voted to be the word of God. Had they voted otherwise, all the people, since calling themselves Christians, had believed otherwise — for the belief of the one comes from the vote of the other. Who the people were that did all this, we know nothing of; they called themselves by the general name of the Church, and this is all we know of the matter.
</blockquote>

<h2>[AD 1764] <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire' target='_blank'>Voltaire's</a> Philosophical Dictionary</h2>

In this book, Voltaire writes (<a href='http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/voltaire-the-works-of-voltaire-vol-iv-philosophical-dictionary-part-2/simple#lf0060-04_head_087' target='_blank'>Councils, Section III</a>):
<blockquote>
We shall here examine only the great councils: the lesser ones are not worth the trouble. The first was that of Nice, assembled in the year 325 of the modern era, after Constantine had written and sent by Osius his noble letter to the rather turbulent clergy of Alexandria...

We have already said, that in the supplement to the Council of Nice it is related that the fathers, being much perplexed to find out which were the authentic and which the apocryphal books of the Old and the New Testament, laid them all upon an altar, and the books which they were to reject fell to the ground. What a pity that so fine an ordeal has been lost!
</blockquote>

<h2>[AD 900] <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodicon_Vetus' target='_blank'>Synodicon Vetus</a></h2>

Around 900 AD, the Synodicon Vetus was written. This anonymous, psuedo-historical book contains information on synods and ecumenical councils up through the year 887 AD.

In this book, we read (<a href='https://archive.org/details/cfhb-11.1-nicetae-choniatae-historia/CFHB%2015_Synodicon%20Vetus/page/n29/mode/2up?view=theater' target='_blank'>section 35, page 29</a>):
<blockquote>
The divine and sacred First Ecumenical Council of three hundred and eighteen God-inspired fathers was convened at Nicaea, metropolis of the province of Bithynia. Its presiding leaders were the presbyters Vito and Vicentius taking the place of Rome's Pope Sylvester and his successor Julius, Alexander of Alexandria, Macarius of Jerusalem, Eustathius of Antioch, the presbyter Alexander representing Metrophanes of Constantinople, Hosius the bishop of Cordoba, and Constantine the apostle among Christian emperors. This holy council attached the term "consubstantial" to the Holy Trinity, fixed the time of the divine and mystical Passover, and set forth the divinely inspired teaching of the Creed against all heretics, Arius, Sabellius, Photinus, Paul of Samosata, Manes, Valentinus, Marcion, and their followers. It condemned also Meletius of Thebais, along with those ordained by him, and Eusebius of Nicomedia. <ins>The canonical and apocryphal books it distinguished in the following manner: in the house of God the books were placed down by the holy altar; then the council asked the Lord in prayer that the inspired works be found on top and--as in fact happened--the spurious on the bottom.</ins>
</blockquote>

Circulating for centuries via handwritten copies, this work was first printed in AD 1601 by Johannes Pappus (a Lutheran theologian of Strasbourg) - thus giving us Robert Taylor's source ("Pappus, in his Synodicon to the council of Nice").

There are many details only recorded in this book (and found nowhere else in history) that scholars find spurious, as well as some councils or synods recorded that scholars suspect never happened - casting significant doubt on the accuracy of its recorded account of the canon being determined at the Council of Nicea.

<h2>[AD 543] <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiodorus' target='_blank'>Cassiodorus'</a> Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum</h2>

In his Institutions of Divine and Secular Learning, Book I, XIV. The Division of Divine Scripture according to the Septuagint, Cassiodorus writes (<a href='https://archive.org/details/cassiodorusinsti0000cass/page/138/mode/2up' target='_blank'>pages 137-138</a>):
<blockquote>
This text is varied being translated by many people, as is stated in the prologue of the Psalter, and Jerome left it carefully emended and arranged; and I have judged that all three sets of divisions ought to be marked in this book, so that when they are carefully considered and treated they seem not to disagree but rather explain one another. As a result, although many Fathers - St Hilary, bishop of Poitiers, and Rufinus, a priest of Aquileia, and Epiphanius, bishop of Cyprus, and the <ins>Councils of Nicaea</ins> and Chalcedon - have said things not contradictory to one another but only different, all have, nevertheless, by their divisions, fitted the sacred books to the appropriate mysteries, as also happens in the harmonies of the Gospels where we regard the events with faith although they differ in the way they are told.
</blockquote>

Rudolph Cornely (a Jesuit biblical scholar, AD 1830-1908) believed that in this passage Cassiodorus was implying that the Nicene Fathers took up the issue of Christian Canon. 

Cornely writes in <a href='https://archive.org/details/historicaeetcri00corngoog/page/24/mode/2up' target='_blank'>Introductio specialis in historicos Veteris Testamenti libros</a> (page 24):
<blockquote>
Num  prima  synodus  oecumenica  quidquam  de  canone  Scripturarum  statuerit, dubitatur  quidem  a  nonnullis,  sed  argumenta  historica  omne  prudens  dubium  videntur  excludere.  [...] Porro  Cassiodorus  (De  instit.  div.  lit.  14) quoque  synodum  Nicaenam  in  eodem  ordine  recenset  cum  S.  Hilario,  Rufino, Epiphanio,  qui  omnes  catalogo  stabilito  " per  divisiones  suas  libros  divinos  sacramentis  competentibus  aptaverunt "  i.  e.  eorum  numerum  ita  stabiliverunt ,  ut  in eo  mystici  aliquid  significaretur.
<hr>
It is indeed doubted by some whether the first ecumenical synod established anything about the canon of the Scriptures, but historical evidence seems to exclude all reasonable doubt. [...] Furthermore, Cassiodorus (De instit. div. lit. 14) also lists the Synod of Nicaea in the same order with St. Hilary, Rufinus, and Epiphanius, who all in an established list "adapted the divine books to the competent sacraments through their divisions" i. e. they established their number in such a way that something mystical was signified in it.
</blockquote>

Others, like A.E. Breen (a Catholic theologian, AD 1863-1938) don't see that in Cassiodorus' words. 

Breen writes in <a href='https://archive.org/details/GeneralIntroToStudyOfHolyScripture/page/n375/mode/2up' target='_blank'>A General Introduction to the Study of Holy Scripture</a> (Chapter VIII, Page 361 footnote):
<blockquote>
Cornely defends the genuineness of the canon of Scripture of the Council of Nice. Among his proofs are the following... Cornely quotes some obscure words from Cassiodorus, reproduced  from Hefele Conciliengesch. II. p. 486; but they form no forcible proof. 
</blockquote>

<h2>[AD 420] <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome' target='_blank'>Jerome's</a> Preface to Judith</h2>

In his <a href='http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_preface_judith.htm' target='_blank'>preface to Judith</a>, Jerome writes:
<blockquote>
Among the Hebrews the Book of Judith is found among the Hagiographa, the authority of which toward confirming those which have come into contention is judged less appropriate. [...] But because this book is found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures, I have acquiesced to your request...
</blockquote>

So Jerome, less than 100 years after the council, says that the Nicene Council included Judith (one of the Catholic Deuterocanonal books) among the Sacred Scriptures.

We don't know exactly what Jerome meant by this. Perhaps there are works/records that existed in Jerome's day that haven't survived to the present day, or perhaps Jerome just meant that the council used Judith as scripture in its argumentations on other topics (but is not saying they made a declaration of canon that included Judith).


Rudolph Cornely (a Jesuit biblical scholar, AD 1830-1908) believed that in this passage Jerome was explicitly stating the synod had enumerated in sacred books in some decree, and included Judith among them.

Cornely writes in <a href='https://archive.org/details/historicaeetcri00corngoog/page/24/mode/2up' target='_blank'>Introductio specialis in historicos Veteris Testamenti libros</a> (page 24):
<blockquote>
Num  prima  synodus  oecumenica  quidquam  de  canone  Scripturarum  statuerit, dubitatur  quidem  a  nonnullis,  sed  argumenta  historica  omne  prudens  dubium  videntur  excludere.  Teste S.  Hieronymo  in  Praef.  ad l. Iudith  " hune  librum  synodus  Nicaena  legitur  in  numero  sacrarum  Scripturarum  computasse ";  quibus claris  verbis  non  satisfacit,  qui  ab  uno  alterove  synodi  membro  librum  dicit  esse laudatum  aut  in  publicis  synodi  actis  allegatum;  sed  fatendum  est,  synodum libros  sacros  in  aliquo  decreto  enumerasse  atque  in  eorum  numerum  saltem unum  ex  deuterocanonicis  recepisse.
<hr>
It is indeed doubted by some whether the first ecumenical synod established anything about the canon of the Scriptures, but historical evidence seems to exclude all reasonable doubt. Witness St. Jerome in Pref. to l. Judith "which book the Synod of Nicaea read among the number of sacred Scriptures"; with which clear words he is not satisfied, who says that a book was praised by one or another member of the synod, or alleged in the public acts of the synod; but it must be admitted that the synod enumerated the sacred books in some decree, and included in their number at least one of the deuterocanonical books.
</blockquote>

A.E. Breen (a Catholic theologian, AD 1863-1938) disagrees with this.

As Breen writes in <a href='https://archive.org/details/GeneralIntroToStudyOfHolyScripture/page/n375/mode/2up' target='_blank'>A General Introduction to the Study of Holy Scripture</a> (Chapter VIII, Page 361 footnote):
<blockquote>
Cornely defends the genuineness of the canon of Scripture of the Council of Nice. Among his proofs are the following... St. Jerome in his preface to Judith declares that the Nicene Synod is said to have included the book of Judith among the canonical Scriptures. The proving force of this testimony is not very great, for any approbation of the book in the deliberations of the Council, would justify Jerome's statement. We believe that the Nicene fathers recognized the deuterocanonical books as divine Scripture, but we hold that it is not sufficiently substantiated by historical data, that they drew up an official list of the Holy Scriptures. Had they done so, it would have had a greater influence on the trend of thought of the Greek fathers. St. Athanasius would not have declared that it was a bold and difficult thing to fix the list of the Holy Books, had there been promulgated a catalogue of the same by a council of which he was an important factor, and whose decisions he venerated. 
</blockquote>

Karl Joseph von Hefele (a Catholic bishop and theologian, AD 1809-1893) gives his interpretation of what Jerome's words mean in <a href='https://archive.org/details/ahistoryofthecou00hefeuoft/page/n385/mode/2up' target='_blank'>A History Of The Councils Of The Church</a> (Vol. 1, page 370-371):
<blockquote>
Jerome says... If we conclude from these words that the Fathers of Nicea gave a canon of the genuine books of the Bible, we certainly draw an inference which they do not sustain. The meaning seems rather to be this: the Nicene Fathers quoted this book of Judith, that is to say, made use of it as a canonical book, and so in fact recognised it. In this way the Council of Ephesus implicitly acknowledged the Epistle to the Hebrews, by approving of the anathemas levelled by Cyril against Nestorius, in which this epistle is quoted as a book of the Bible. It is true that, in some memorials left to us by the Council of Nicea, we find no such quotation from the book of Judith; but the difficulty does not lie there: the quotation may have been made <i>vivâ voce</i> in the Council; and this fact may have been laid hold of, and preserved in some document composed by a member of the council. 
</blockquote>

<h2>[AD 393] <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Synod_of_Hippo' target='_blank'>Council of Hippo</a></h2>

Rudolph Cornely (a Jesuit biblical scholar, AD 1830-1908) argues that the 36th canon of the AD 393 Council of Hippo says it is sourced from "Chapter XXIV of the Council of Nicaea", thereby proving the Fathers of Hippo drew their catalog from the decrees of Nicaea. He says the source for this is a ancient book of the 8th or 9th century.

As Cornely writes in <a href='https://archive.org/details/historicaeetcri00corngoog/page/24/mode/2up' target='_blank'>Introductio specialis in historicos Veteris Testamenti libros</a> (page 24):
<blockquote>
Num  prima  synodus  oecumenica  quidquam  de  canone  Scripturarum  statuerit, dubitatur  quidem  a  nonnullis,  sed  argumenta  historica  omne  prudens  dubium  videntur  excludere.  [...] Quibus  accedit  codex  antiquus  saec.  8.  vel  9. (Vallicell.  B.  58.  fol.  77.),  qui  canoni  36.  concilii  Hippon.  a.  393.  hane  praefigit inscriptionem  : " Ut  praeter  Scripturas  catholicas  (canonicas)  nihil  in  ecclesia legatur.  Capituli  XXIV,  Nicaeni  Concilii.  Item  ut  praeter  Scripturas  catholicas nihil  in  ecclesia  legatur  sub  nomine  divinarum  Scripturarum.  Sunt  autem  canonicae  Scripturae  "  etc. ,  atque  sequitur  catalogus  cunctos  primi  et  secundi  canonis libros  intermixtos  exhibens.  Unde  pronum  est  concludere, Hipponenses  Patres catalogum  suum  ex  Nicaenis  decretis,  quae  Caecilianus  Carthag.  secum  in  Africam detulerat,  desumsisse ;  neque  negare  licet,  Nicaenos  Patres  decretum  de  omnibus amplioris  canonis  libris  in  ecclesia  velut  Scripturis  legendis  tulisse. 
<hr>
It is indeed doubted by some whether the first ecumenical synod established anything about the canon of the Scriptures, but historical evidence seems to exclude all reasonable doubt. [...] To these comes the ancient book of the century. 8. or 9. (Vallicell. B. 58. fol. 77.), which canon 36. of the council of Hippo. a. 393. Here he prefaces the inscription: "That nothing be read in the church apart from the Catholic (canonical) Scriptures. Chapter XXIV of the Council of Nicaea. Also that nothing besides the Catholic Scriptures be read in the church under the name of divine Scriptures. But they are the canonical Scriptures," etc., and there follows a catalog showing all the books of the first and second canon intermixed. Whence we are inclined to conclude, that the Fathers of Hippo drew their catalog from the decrees of Nicaea, which Caecilianus of Carthag. He had taken it with him to Africa, had taken it down; nor can it be denied that the Nicene Fathers decreed that all the books of the greater canon should be read in the church as if they were Scriptures. 
</blockquote>


A.E. Breen (a Catholic theologian, AD 1863-1938) disagrees with this, noting that this canon exists "in one sole codex in the Vallicellian library, in Rome."

As Breen writes in <a href='https://archive.org/details/GeneralIntroToStudyOfHolyScripture/page/n375/mode/2up' target='_blank'>A General Introduction to the Study of Holy Scripture</a> (Chapter VIII, Page 361 footnote):
<blockquote>
Cornely defends the genuineness of the canon of Scripture of the Council of Nice. Among his proofs are the following... Cornely also adduces the 36th canon of the Council of Hippo, A. D. 393: "Ut praeter Scripturas Catholicas, nihil in Ecclesia legatur. Capituli XXIV. Nicaeni Concilii. Item ut praeter Scripturas Catholicas nihil in ecclesia legatur sub nomine divinarum Scripturarum. Sunt autem Canonicae Scripturae," etc. The books of both canons are there mentioned. This Canon exists but in one sole codex in the Vallicellian library, in Rome. We are not disposed to detract from what force it may have, but we do not feel warranted to refer the Council of Nice among the proofs of the Canon in the fourth century. Hefele accords no certain authority to the aforesaid Canon. 
</blockquote>

Karl Joseph von Hefele (a Catholic bishop and theologian, AD 1809-1893) more background on how this could have happened in <a href='https://archive.org/details/ahistoryofthecou00hefeuoft/page/n385/mode/2up' target='_blank'>A History Of The Councils Of The Church</a> (Vol. 1, page 367):
<blockquote>
It will be asked why in some parts of the East they should have attributed so great a number of canons to the Council of Nicea. It is not difficult to explain the mistake. We know, indeed, that the canons of various councils were at a very early period collected into one corpus; and in this corpus the canons of Nicea always had the first place, on account of their importance. It happened afterwards, that either accidentally or designedly, some copyists neglected to give the names of the councils to those canons which followed the Nicene. We have already seen that even at Rome there was a copy containing, <i>sub wno titulo</i>, the canons of Nicea and those of Sardica. When these copies were circulated in the East, that which might have been foreseen took place in course of time: viz., from a want of the spirit of criticism, all the later canons which followed after the true canons were attributed to the Council of Nicea.
</blockquote>



<h2>[AD 325] <a href='http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3801.htm' target='_blank'>Council of Nicea</a></h2>

The <a href='http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3801.htm' target='_blank'>records from the Nicene Council</a> that survived to the modern day make no mention of setting a canon of scripture. 

As Catholic theologian Breen summarizes in <a href='https://archive.org/details/GeneralIntroToStudyOfHolyScripture/page/n375/mode/2up' target='_blank'>A General Introduction to the Study of Holy Scripture</a> (Chapter VIII, Page 361 footnote):
